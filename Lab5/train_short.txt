10003|1|boring plot not funny everything went wrong
10005|1|Terrible Movie
10036|1|Whoopie - painful as always .
10044|1|Sad , I actually do like Adam Sandler . He is a decent comedian , but he can't act . And what is it with his films ? They just don't seem to have any signs of a cohesive plot to them .
10045|1|Adam Sandler shows once again he can't act in this travesty that has him using profanity around little children and knocking McDonalds . Most humor is quite sick and this movie is horrid . Don't even take a bribe to see it !
10070|1|Frankly , the moon is where I'd like both Kaufman and Carrey to go . And stay .
10071|1|It wasn't that funny or interesting .
10073|1|Proving Jim Carrey and drama do not mix .
10085|1|The image of Andy Kaufman as a nice , funny guy is shattered by reality . He is a mean , twisted , manipulative individual . The movie is marketed like it is a comedy and this is far from the truth . The reality of Andy Kaufman's life was not all fun and games and this movie is his life story , but it is sold ( like Kaufman ) to the public as something it is not .
10086|1|This was one of the only movies I have ever walked out of . It is the worst thing I have seen in a long , long time . The theatre we saw it in accidentally played one of the reels upside down and backwards . That was the only time we laughed . We were lucky though , because we saw it at the cheap theatre and it only cost us $ 1 . 50 each . Of course , we still felt ripped off .
10087|1|I thought the stale nachos from the theater concession were the best part of this movie . It was a long drawn out film that never took the time to really develop any of the characters -- not even Andy . And Courtney Love the actor -- someone please get me another stale snack !
10099|1|This is the most unfunny , makes no sense movie I have ever seen .
10113|1|Kirsten Dunst SUCKS .
10115|1|Worst movie in the world . . . CHEERLEADERS SUCK ! !
10119|1|stupid
10123|1|Why is it that movies set at high school nowadays have to be sick . Besides the attractive female cheerleaders and a few eccentric cameos , the movie stinks . They combine very sick gags , profanity , disrespectful attitudes , fights and obscene gestures . Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen .
10124|1|Pathetic . Goes to show how shallow the world is nowadays .
10129|1|No way ! I fell asleep about 5 minutes into it .
10154|1|I gave this movie a one because it was horrible . It was just about cheerleading , and I'm a guy . I need action .
10167|1|They should have called it Stupid if not for Alica Silverstone it would have been a complete waste of time .
10172|1|'clueless' . . . how appropriate . . . seems the producers knew it from the beginning . . . any you airheads rating this movie great : of 10 million sperm , YOU were the faster ? ? ? ?
 1019|1|This was just another dumb blow it up movie . Willis is a better actor than this and would have to wait many years to show it .
  102|1|I think a brilliant performance by Hopkins is utterly wasted in this scurrilous piece of trash .
10203|1|My husband and best friend dragged me out to this movie , thinking that this was all about T & A , but it was something WORSE--it was a thinly-veiled chick flick ! ( Though , it was kinda amusing to see their reactions after the movie , it made it almost worth sitting through it ) . It's one of those little girl in a big town trying to make it on her own kind of movies , and if you like that kind of thing , then go for it . I'll pass , though .
10205|1|sucked !
10209|1|Dont waste your money on it and if you are at someones home who owns it and suggests to watch it , dont even waste your time ! !
10210|1|Just because a movie has hotties doesn't automatically make it good--case in point .
10214|1|Wait a minute . . . . this is supposed to be a comedy ? I didn't laugh a single time throughout this movie . In fact , I don't think any of the others I was with did either . The actual film it took to make this movie would have been better spent taping me scratch myself . Who produces this kind of trash ?
10235|1|This movie was horrible . Nothing new in this movie , same old girl in the big city . Only thing worth praise were the advertisements .
10280|1|Coyote Ugly has no plot . The storyline is as skimpy as the costumes the women at the bar wear . It's a poor attempt at a remake of Flashdance and its major audience seems to be LONELY LONELY teenage boys with no access to porn .
10297|1|I'm here to set things straight on RateItAll . com once and for all . This is to be my first opinion . Here I go : Bringing Down the House , does not necessarily tell a story which is outdated , but rather one which should embarass humanity into making its reddest face and its most solemn look of all . Let's look at the issues tackled in this film , set in 2003 : 1 ) Slavery , 2 ) Black ( and White ) Stereotypes , and 3 ) Cultural Appropriation . Slavery officially ended over 100 years ago , ( to those born more recently , right after Gettysburg and Gods and Generals took place ) , but as we can obviously see in our day to day experience , racism is still rampant , be it in the white dominated media , the movies , or in general conversation and confrontation . What is baffling to me is why this film should combine an early 1800s attitude towards blacks with our current sensibilities in such an artless and tasteless manner . Steve Martin's character and his family can't be seen in public with Latifah ? She has to pose as their nanny to be accepted socially ? . . . I can't even finish . The fact that this movie was a success theatrically just shows how ignorant we are as a culture . What a sloppy and hopeless pile of poo this movie was . ( Note : Despite these issues I have brought up briefly , I have to say that this film began with the most boring internet scene of all time . Any filmmaker who thinks that filming a computer being used for Instant Messaging is a good way to engage viewers is stoned . )
10301|1|To call the characterzations in this movie stereotypes would be an insult to stereotypes . Thirty years ago this movie would have been out of date . Martin and Latifah should be ashamed of themselves to get involved with such a stupid depiction of blacks and whites . The really offensive thing about this movie is that its supposed to be some sort of social commentary .
10305|1|The parts that weren't downright stupid were downright nauseating . A waste of Jim Carrey's talent .
10324|1|Terrible movie , I hated it and can't believe they made a second one . Jim Carrey is loud , obnoxious and not funny , more on the side of exaggerated and gross . I don't like movies that insult my intelligence .
10336|1|This movie is surprising bad . Jack Nickelson is a good actor , but even his acting could not save this piece of junk . Kathy Bates , a fine actress , is the only other bright spot in this otherwise dull and unwitty clunker . I did like the monolouge narration of Nickelson for his adopted son , but over-all , I was very disappointed with this movie .
10339|1|About Schmidt easily qualifies for my list of the ten worst movies I've ever seen . Its incredibly slow pace , depressing tone , and pathetic attempt to convey something deep made it extremely unpleasant and annoying to watch . The plot goes nowhere , and I couldn't find anything compelling about the characters . I'm surprised to note that this is the first time I haven't been impressed by Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates . There's simply not a single reason to watch this movie .
10356|1|I rarely hate movies , but this one was awful ! The plot was stupid and the ending was really bad . Adam Sandler is very funny when he plays crazy people , but in this movie he played the straight man to Jack Nicholson . Adam Sandler just can't play normal !
10382|1|Working Girl has got to be the worst Harrison Ford movie ever made . The movie is like listening to girl talk for 2 straight hours . It's like the designing women movie . The plot is simple : Sigourney Weaver is a mean and greedy boss of a man and a woman , and the woman is Griffith in her mindless role .
10385|1|Never even consider renting this movie - it's terrible . Harrison Ford made a rare mistake and agreed to work with a terrible script and one of the most annoying actresses ever ( Melanie Griffith ) . Actually , now that I think about it , he made the same mistake with 6 Days , 7 Nights . Anyway , this movie is a joke and isn't even worth tearing apart .
10386|1|Worst movie ever . Are you kidding me ?
10403|1|NOT FUNNY
10429|1|I can t tell you what most women want because to be frank I don t give a flying fig . But speaking as a woman , I could have done without this farce . Considering his past success in the Lethal Weapon films , I will say that I feel Mel Gibson has more than proven he can be halfway decent at madcap , insane comedy . However , he needs to realize that his ability to act nuts-o extremely well does not a leading man in light romantic comedy make . This movie made it glaringly apparent that he was never meant to follow in the footsteps of Fred Astaire , Cary Grant , or Gene Kelly . He is , for the most part , an action figure with acting ability who has managed to make some admirable hits within a sea of okay films . If what he has done best so far in his career can be compared to bygone film styles I would say that his forte has been the sweeping epic ( Braveheart , the Patriot ) . What Women Want was almost painful to watch as he clumped his way through this silly , clumsily written game of gender self awareness . Helen Hunt on the other hand after years in fluffy TV sitcom and an acting range that apparently exceeds Gibson s by about 50 % seemed more up to the job . But even she couldn t save this pathetic ship full of holes ( a few of her lines were actually embarrassingly stupid ) . Not even semi-funny cameos by the likes of Bette Midler were of much help to this albatross . After forcing myself to stay awake I flipped off the recorder once again thankful I had rented the DVD rather than having paid theater admission and even more glad that I d gotten a special discount rate for signing up with a new video store . Don t waste your time unless you re a major Gibson fan it may be the only way you won t notice the smell .
10447|1|this movie was not funny it actually sucked .
10466|1|Trash . This type of stuff is what rots away the moral fiber of our youth . Trust me . It makes the partying stupid guy who doesn't take college seriously look like a king and the kid who actually listens to his parents look like a huge geek . I didn't like it at all .
10468|1|Tom Green is a cancer . . .
10470|1|I detest Tom Green ( the most unfunny man in North America ) . The black fraternity scenes were too heavily borrowed .
10474|1|Road Trip is an extremly unfunny and stupid comedy starring Tom Green who is a college teacher and tell his students about his days in college and what happened .
10483|1|Road Trip is pure trash . It is so sad that people feel they must constantly resort to this kind of toilet humor in order to get a laugh . A bunch of sorry actors who want to be comedians .
10484|1|This movie was horrible ! It was not on the same level as There's Something About Mary . The movie did have some funny moments and would have been much better without Tom Green . He was stupid and brought down the movie . The black fraternity scene was pretty amusing .
 1050|1|Wow . People actually liked this movie ? Amazing !
10518|1|Pointless child-like craziness . I could never even begin to imagine that this would ever happen off the silver screen .
10527|1|A stupid story . . . . . no laughs for me .
10543|1|I'm probably being harsher on this movie than I should because it's hard to reconcile its amazing popularity with the fact that it stinks , especially if you get sick of physical , cartoon-like comedy after the first person slips on something and falls down the stairs . And it's not Chevy Chase making the fall .
10545|1|Home Alone . . . are you kidding ? Mcauley , how's your wife ?
10549|1|You've got a baby ? In a bar ? ? ? You've got Reese Witherspoon ? In a movie ? ? ?
10553|1|Don't even bother watching this piece of crap . Watch the trailer instead it reveals the entire plot . You'll save a couple hours of your life .
10557|1|Considering great performances by Witherspoon and Bergan , the film is possibly one of the worst romantic comedies of all time . McConahay ( I can't spell his name . . lol ) is the perfect contender for the next white trash , smelly role on the big screen . I hated this film , and I hope you will too . Ta-ta !
10580|1|I agree 100 % ! ! ! Gene hackman couldn't even help this movie .
10581|1|Keanu sucks but so does the movie . You'd think Gene Hackman would make the movie , but he doesn't . They have cut so many scenes out of the movie that the story doesn't flow naturally . Very poor movie .
10582|1|Pitiful .
10606|1|Martha , you have to keep old Fido in the house . He dragged in another stinky polecat again !
10607|1|One of the five worst movies ever produced for a large audience . And there is nothing worse than having to watch it with a pack of females who think it is romantic and charming . It isn't . It is contrived to the Nth degree and desperately trying to be quirky and loveable . Good for people trying to diet because this film will make it difficult for the viewer to keep his food down . On a par with Superman III .
10609|1|long and boring . i can't even remember the storyline now . it was that boring
10614|1|it's sad really . . . people watch that ? it had no real amusing points . . . but my sides to hurt from laughing at the crappy acting . . . Hue Grant needs a better job
10621|1|It's not the worst movie I've ever seen , cause that was the Norwegian film Dis , but I'm quite sure it's the worst 1999-film probably the worst comedy in the 90ies ! If there was an Oscar for Worst Actress , Julia Roberts would certainly get it ! In 1990ies we aren't satisfied with voiceless boring movies with no action ! : - (
10623|1|What a bore fest this was it was not funny , it wasn't any thing . It just went on and on and was totally pointless . Avoid at all costs .
10647|1|My significant other insisted this was a movie for me -- the reviews he had read were spectacular . He was wrong and so were those reviewers . I cannot recall much about this long drawn out tale other than I should have gotten the largest popcorn they sold -- the meal would have made the experience a bit shy of a big waste of time .
 1067|1|The acting was ok . The accents were very annoying . The swearing was unnecesary . And the woodchipper part was just plain old nasty . Save yourself the time and money and don't watch this film
10677|1|Adam Sandler sucks !
10680|1|Yet another stupid Adam Sandler movie with lowbrow humor , profanity and no laughs whatsoever . Adam Sandler , you are under arrest for making a bad movie . Henry Winkler , you can go , we understand .
10686|1|The only funny scenes were in the trailer .
10687|1|This is the worst movie I've ever seen .
10688|1|Sometimes even the funniest actor can mess up with a movie , and The Waterboy proves this . Adam Sandler plays a waterboy . Bored yet ? His mother cuts fish . Yet ? His girlfriend dumped him and came back . Yet ? His coach is Henry Winkler . Yet ?
10693|1|Adam Sandler really goes over the top , sending a message to the audience of careless child care . It runs really slow at times .
10709|1|How could a guy who was so funny in Happy Gilmore be so incredibly lame in Waterboy ? I can't believe I spent $ 7 to see this crap . Truly awful .
10714|1|Dry and boring .
10715|1|Worst movie to be produced in a long , long time . Just plain stupid .
10722|1|Dull , predictable , and insufferably stupid .
10729|1|Of all the comments made about violence in the movies today Nurse Betty has one of the most violent ( and unnessacary ) scenes I have ever witnessed . It was so bad that it totally ruined the rest of the movie . This is NO COMEDY ! ! ! That aside Nurse Betty quicky put me to sleep for the rest of the movie . To bad , this should have been a great movie . It has a lot of fine actors ( I love Morgan Freeman ) and what should have been a very good story . However , one scene , one little moment , ruines the experience .
10745|1|my friends said this was the funniest movie ever . I watched it and had no clue what they were talking about . It had an extremley dissapointing ending , such bad humor , and some bad acting by good actors .
10751|1|Worst remake ever
10760|1|Although I've never seen the full movie , and some people will criticize me for making a comment , I've seen the previews and heard about it . Lets think , they are making the devil look like some sexy woman . That is absolutely disgusting . I wouldn't want to watch a movie like that . For a start , the devil is far from attractive . Like charmed , these producers have made the dark side look attractive . You want to know what the real devil is like , well for a start he is the ugliest monster in existance , secondly he hates all of humanity's guts ( and that's Biblical fact ) . He was a murderer and lier from the beginning . Yeah , it may seem cool having this beautiful woman make the devil look beautiful , but if anyone were to really give their soul to the devil for some sensual pleasures , they will pay for it in a big way , for eternity too . It is not worth risking your whole eternity over , just to get a bit of pleasure on this earth . You want to know why the devil tries to tempt people , because he thinks everyone is stupid enough to fall for it . Because in reality , you have two choices . You can keep $ 1 and pay a trillion dollars ( have your earthly pleasures and not be accepted into God's Kingdom ) , or you can pay $ 1 now , which will hurt , but get $ 1 trillion dollars back ( give your life over to the Lord Jesus ) . What one would you choose . Judging by that movie , I know what the devil would want you to choose ( keep the dollar , loose the trillion ) . This is not to push my beliefs or to frighten or offend anyone , these are just my thoughts on this movie . Plus it seems people arn't judging this movie on it's content or it's morality message ( which is terrible ) , they are judging this movie based on lust ( because they think the woman was attractive ) .
10766|1|Awful ! This movie is lame ! ! !
 1077|1|This movie was horrible ! No purpose whatsoever , gruesome scenes , and just horrible situations . I can't believe people actually think of such things . Walked away from the movie with nothing and don't care ever recall it again .
10772|1|God only knows what Harold Ramis was thinking . . . . .
 1078|1|It had Canadian actors and script , which no one likes . The plot was terrible , yet predictable .
10789|1|Just a really ignornat , mindless romp ! Will Ferrell running around naked was embarassing .
10798|1|Tediously unfunny scattershot comedy is a gross-out fest wasting all three of it's main actors . A bad rip-off of Animal House with no merit .
10799|1|Pretty brutal . I found myself braindead and tired on a Sunday night , and Taxi with Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah was on cable . And I watched it . Awful storyline , cutesie dialogue , tons of cliches - very painful to watch . Not recommended .
10803|1|A retarted piece of crap .
10812|1|this movie was gay
10821|1|Witness , my friends , the crude of the crude : I can see this movie being used by women for evidence to kick guys off of the planet forever . At least , they should kick off mindless fools like the actors and writers of this numbingly-idiotic motion picture . In what has to be a record of some sort , over 200 ( yes , you read it right , my friends , TWO HUNDRED ) uses of the f-word can be cataloged . That's in addition to over 150 OTHER crude words . This makes you wonder if there could actually be any real dialogue . Of course , there is none . Crude and explicit sexual content is so crass and rampant that I can't get into it on this honorable public opinion forum . Drug use rivals the moronic Cheech Chong movies . Acting is bad , and I mean BAAAAADDDDD ! Of course , George Carlin makes an appearance , so it is automatically bad . They've even got kids cussing in this movie ! No child actor should be forced into a movie like this one ! The list of crimes in this brain-dead movie goes on : its sexist , it has inappropriate music , there is imitative behavior that kids shouldn't replicate , graphic violence and disrespectful attitudes towards women and policemen . This movie is one of the worst movies of all time , that is for sure . Avoid this terror at all costs . Just go rent something nice and family-friendly , read a book , play a Nintendo game or write a story of your own . But , whatever you do , pay this waste of film no heed .
10824|1|SUCH a STUPID movie . . . . geesh
10829|1|Spare me .
10834|1|It is on my list of Ten Worst movies I've ever saw ( or in this case slept through ) . It had all the suspense of a half-hearted game of Clue Jr . , the story was meandering and wearisome , and the sound quality of the DVD , coupled with the bad British accents made most of the movie sound mushy and inaudible . It was so painfully boring that we rented it for a whole week and popped it in our DVD player 4 nights and fell in and out of repose all week . By the time I woke up for the ending where they reveal whodunit , I commented , I don't even know who they f--k got killed , and angrilly went back to sleep . I don't dig Robert ( I hate America ) Altman movies . I don't understand why every big-time actor has to make an appearance in an Altman movie . Must be some coastal elite Blue States liberal thing .
10841|1|For me , it was a 1 . Bad , real bad . Gosford Park is too long . It's a British period piece wrapped up in a murder mystery . 10 of us went to see it . # walked out , 3 fell asleep , 3 figured it out , and 1 didn't care . But , if you're into the Brits and you really care about the charmed lives of British nobility , and you can tolerate a long movie where very little happens , then go see it . On second thought , . . .
10847|1|this movie was sooo stupid ! i dont like martin shean . this movie was nasty .
10868|1|This was a comedy , thats news to me because I found no humor in it what so ever . Its typical Will Farrel fare a lot flailing about and badly delivered dialog . Don't waste your money renting the DVD its just no worth it .
 1087|1|awful
10876|1|I get to watch movies for free , and apparently you get what you pay for with this one . Along with Around the World in 80 Days and Gods and Generals , this is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last several years . It's just further proof that SNL alumni are almost incapable of making good movies anymore .
10880|1|A dumb-ass movie , appealing to dumb-asses . About as funny as a rubber crutch .
10886|1|Worst movie ever . Take me back to Old School ! ! ! Pleeeeeeeeease !
10901|1|Vomitous nonsense .
10904|1|Drew , you were probably taking tongue kisses when you were 12 .
10914|1|I would probably like this movie if I didn't have a penis .
10919|1|THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE AND VERY DISAPPOINTING .
 1092|1|A nasty film by a director whose stock in trade is over the top unpleasantness e . g . The Fury . De Palma has to be one of the worst film makers of all time , right down there with Tarantino and David Lynch . If you want to see how gangster films should be done stick with Coppola and Scorsese .
10932|1|People , this movie sucked and still does . Nothing will compare to the equally bad original . This one is the exact same tale from the original , only in New York . Uninspired and lame .
10943|1|Don't waste your time with this retread of Risky Business . In fact , rent Risky Business instead !
10971|1|Whatever happened to the hilarious comedianne whom brought us comedies such as The Distinguished Gentleman and The Nutty Professor ? He now does terrible , mindless comedies such as I Spy , The Adventures Of Pluto Nash . . . and now Daddy Day Care . This film is putrid and disgusting . The only merit here is a fun performance by Anjelica Huston as the rival day-care owner . Otherwise , stay away . It's like watching a bad remake of Kindergarten Cop .
10977|1|Make up was excellent but Martin Lawerence is such an idiot . He couldn't act his way out of a wet paper sack .
10981|1|I can't believe I even bothered to watch this crap . Martin Lawrence ? A man in drag ? It was stupid , disgusting , lame , suck , dumb , so many words you could explain it with . Nothing new , whoever made this shouldn't have even made the effort . And Martin Lawrence is TERRIBLE ! Unrealistic and stupid . Simply avoid . Summary : A DUMB , DISGUSTING , LAME FILM .
10982|1|I wish Martin Lawrence would stop making movies because he is really starting to bug me . This is the worst one yet . He just recycled Tootsie and made it black which is absolutely pointless and unfunny .
10987|1|I'm not a Martin Lawrence fan . I've never have been able to get into men pretending to be women or vice versa , regardless of the plot . This movie bombed as a comedy .
11021|1|How did this movie get funded ? ? ?
11034|1|Fell asleep during this movie . And I wasn't even that tired .
11046|1|Crap .
11055|1|Another stupid teen raunch-fest . I'm waiting for a G-rated movie with teenage heroes . . .
11068|1|This movie looks so boring to me .
11069|1|I don't even want to see this mean , terrorizing piece of crap , it's about making fun of christians . And i'm a christian .
11070|1|mm should go blonde damnit
11076|1|Quite possibly the most embarrassingly bad movie I ve ever seen . I didn t think Jim Carey could fall any farther down on my list of actors I least like to watch but darned if he didn t manage to do just that the other night when I tried to make it through this film . Not since Ishtar have I seen such a criminal waste of celluloid . I don t mind a little mindless bathroom humor once in awhile but not when it s this blatantly mindless and appears to be the sole purpose of the movie . Renee Zellwegger must cringe when she looks back on her decision to become involved in this abortion . I would even think Carey must flinch a little and with his record that s saying a lot .
11077|1|Multiple Personality Disorder is not a laughing matter ! It is a mental illness ! People actually suffer from it ! This movie just pokes fun at people who do . They should have at least tried to keep the humour tasteful and attempted to RAISE AWARENESS about a disorder that has caused so many people pain .
11079|1|I was watching this movie at home . It was recommended to me so I gave it a chance . I think it is the most horrible , tasteless movie I have seen in a long time . The humour was just way over the top and it just left me with a sick feeling inside . I had to stop watching it once I realized it just wasn't getting any better . I consider myself to have a good sense of humour but this movie is just wrong . Now that we have gone this far in movies , it's hard to go back to anything that is pure and good . It's all about one shocking extreme to the next . I hate to see what it store for our next generation of movie goers . I don't recommend this movie .
11084|1|This movie sucked donkey crank . Yes Jim Carrey was awesome and yes there were 2 or 3 funny scenes but the plot was embarassing ( as though they were making up the story as they went along ) and the gags were old and over-used . This story-writer should be shot .
11085|1|This is the worst comedy movie I v ever seen . . . It seems that they wrote the script as they shoot the movie . . . I love Jim carrey , but not enough to put up with this movie . . . I was wondering all the time when it will end . . .
11092|1|Worst movie I have ever seen . If you find yeast infections , vulgar language and men nursing off a stranger entertaining , you will love it .
11095|1|This is one of the most irritating movie ever . I think Jim Carrey need not to act crazy and get the attention of all viewers .
11099|1|Very vulgar and without any artistic value whatso ever .
11140|1|Not smart comedy but stupid comedy !
11149|1|Manages to make the first two , ( which are so bad they make my teeth hurt ) look like great art .
11150|1|I want to vomit just by watching this .
11162|1|Just see the first one . The other two are like a bunch of Saturday Night Live sketches lumped together and dragged out as much as humanly possible . The biggest laugh was when Ozzy Osborne was shown , just for how dated the movie will be in a few years . The first one was funny and original , they should have just left it alone after that .
11164|1|Three words ( plus an article ) : Crude , rude and lewd .
11165|1|IT'S THE SAME THING AS ALL THE OTHERS !
11171|1|Could this movie get any worse ?
11184|1|This is one of those movies that they should of left alone . Part two should have not been made . After watching it I thought , This could have waited for Blockbuster night !
11185|1|I thought the movie was very stupid , and it wasn't as good and funny as the first one . The one reason I didn't like it is because I almost feel asleep in the theater while I was watching it , and I thought it was too long .
11230|1|Jennifer Garner SUCKS .
11231|1|Oh god that was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . The plot was pathetic , and yeah redninefan , Garner should stick to TV . The only good part was the music but that doesnt deserve another star . Not Recommended .
11233|1|I hated it .
11247|1|I'm still trying to figure out WHY the director ( s ) , writer ( s ) , producer ( s ) gave this movie a comedic slant .
11251|1|This is the first film that Billy Bob Thornton let me down , as did the directors . Perhaps they should have watched some film noir before they tried to ape it . If they had they would have noticed that the main characters do more than just smoke and ponder .
11270|1|I'd rather stare at a rock for 12 hours than sit through this joke again . I guess the only thing that makes it a comedy is that the entire movie was indeed a joke .
11271|1|I never thought a movie could actually be a true insult to gigolos everywhere , but this B-rated piece of junk should be thrown in the garbage disposal to never be heard from again . . . a total waste of time . . .
11272|1|How anyone could give this more than two stars is beyond me . Starring the only actor less funny and talented than Adam Sandler .
11274|1|i hated it
11284|1|This is one of the worst movies ever made . I did not laugh once . The jokes were very cliche and dull . Almost like the jokes I used to hear in elementary school . Really , is a man getting his butt crack waxed funny ? The humor is rediculousely dumb to the point of making the viewer feel sorry for everyone involved . Word of advice if you like good comedies don't see anything by the production team who brought you Big Daddy or Deuce Bigalow . If you are a numb skull go check it out .
11296|1|Wretched . Worse than pulling teeth .
11311|1|56 million dollars ! ! how , as a movie watching culture , do we explain THIS ! Scooby Doo is proof positive that the cinema , as well as the American Cultural landscape , have fallen into an irreversable void from which nothing of asthetic value is sure to never rise again . Sure , people took their kids ? TAKE THEM TO THE MUSEUM INSTEAD ! ! ! heck , at least go see Spirit AGAIN , before seeing this piece of Freddie Prinze Crap ! !
11335|1|Please . All I have to say is Jennifer Love Hewitt ? UGGHHHH !
11342|1|Uptown girls was really boring and the thing with the spinning teacups was really wierd .
11347|1|Britany Murphy is one of the worst actresses on the planet . I won't tell you how I really feel about her . This movie was a predictable load of crap . I like Dakota Fanning , but her character was such a obnoxious bratty little twit . One could predict the next line , the next scene and how it was going to end . Don't waste your time or money on the DVD either .
11357|1|Isn't it wonderful that the idea of a girl growing up these days requires that she dress like a slut , bare the midriff , and have pants that barely come up past the pubic line ? I have no idea what this movie is about , but once again here's a child actor who turns 18 and suddenly dresses like s street walker . I'm so glad I don't have children .
11365|1|I saw a sneak preview of What A Girl Wants , and here is my review . This film contains the usual plot of girl wants to reunite with her birth father . In this case , the father lives in a posh mansion in England , and the girl is coming from a hip community in America . She meets dad , wins his trust , falls in love with another boy , gets into a catfight with the boy's other girlfriend , and the film is over . That is what to expect ( mostly ) from this film . Amanda Bynes should not have signed on to do this film , because it's even below HER ( oh my god . . did I just say that ! ) . It's really that bad . It could've been better . It's not Amanda's fault though . It's the screenplay , and the material that the actors are given . Both Colin Firth and Kelly Preston aren't given adequate screen time to make their cases , so it seems like a one-dimensional storyline for Amanda's character . Plus , the storyline wanders off far too many times , and there are a few too many limp one liners that could make everyone in the audience nauceous ! The boy-meets-girl storyline may appeal to teenage girls , but the rest does not click . What A Girl Wants isn't .
11374|1|Jack Black SUCKS .
11391|1|Why oh why ? I would much rather watch the original Mr . Deeds 10 times in a row , rather than this forgettable piece of trash .
11396|1|Not funny in the slightest .
11409|1|I can only comment on the part I actually saw , the first 15-20 minutes ! Anyone who raised kids like this needs to be shot !
11410|1|This movie is a total waste of money it is so stupid . I was expecting to laugh my head off durring the movie and I didn't even laugh once and plus I fell asleep cause it was so boring , don't rent this one , it sucks big time .
11411|1|I waited for the funny parts that never came . There is another 'Cheaper by the Dozen' movie that is one of the old classics that was based on the life of the Frank Gilbreth family . It cannot be duplicated and is absolutely nothing like the new one . I promise if you want to see one of the best and funniest of the old classics this is a must see . Clifton Webb starred as the father .
11424|1|Yech ! ! Two bad the writer didn't have one .
11439|1|this is the most boring movie i seen in my life i dont know why a lot of people like this movie there was no comedy and i almost feel asleep during the movie . if your tired then watch this movie and it will put u to sleep .
11441|1|The worst movie I have ever seen in my life . I swear to god it made me dumber . After the first 15 minutes me and my friend looked at each other almost on cue and said out loud What the % @ # $ I am still in shock that so many people on this website actually like this no-brain garbage .
11445|1|I don't see why so many people are raving about how funny this movie was .
11449|1|Seriously , the worst movie of the year . Humor will appeal to those who think bodily functions are funny . Lots of akward moments
11458|1|Utterly crude , cynical , sexist , and mean-spirited film--like all National Lampoon trash .
11470|1|Maybe they should have consulted a Movie Planner !
11484|1|poo
11497|1|Good lord--why anybody thought this movie was funny was beyond me . The first movie in a long time where I was ready to walk out of the theatre . The jokes were overdone and cloying--most of the time I was embarrased for the actors trying to pull off this flop . An enormous disappointment from Mr . Stiller whose other work I enjoy greatly .
11499|1|Beyond stupid !
11508|1|What a horrible sequel to a funny original . Those friends are such losers . The kid from rookie of the year is such a girl . . . way too sensative . Mia S . and her boyfriend need to be written out of the script . . . LOSERS ! ! ! ! Only Stiffler and his bro saved the movie .
11515|1|Is this the fate of TV comedy in ten years ? This disguisting waste of film didn't deserve to be made , especially into a useless sequel . These sex-centered teen movies show what teens shouldn't do . Whatever happened to good old clean comedy ? Now , I'm no prude , but is anything besides sex funny ? Of course it is ! Take a look at Beverly Hillbillies , I Love Lucy on TV or Toy Story 2 , Some Like it Hot as far as Movies . Rated R , which is an underrate in my opinion .
11517|1|This piece of worthless filth is not only a testament to the emptiness of modern American cinema , but also a cultural void , sucking the spirits of a generation of youth . Not only is it unfunny , but also painfully crude , with predictable gags about ( snicker ) MASTURBATION ( snicker ) and people that stick flutes up each others' asses . . . What ? It resorts to recirculations of the already wothless gags of the original , and continues in its predecessor's path of the dehumanization of women . The glorifiaction of almost pre-adolescent behavior is extended into a sequence praising , in essence , the male predeliction for pornographic voyuerism of lesbians , and exhibits reluctance among the boys toward homosexuality- but they'll do anything to watch two girls together . There's nothing sexy about anything in the film , but there is offense on layers . The worst insult to women since Road Trip .
 1152|1|Hunt for Red ExitSign was so bad . I hunted for the red exit sign , found it , and left . I cant believe anyone falls for this dumb over acted crap .
11535|1|Steve needs to stop trying cash in on the market hype and stick to what he's good at , movies aren't his thing !
11537|1|I was hoping the snake would pop out of the screen and put us out of our misery . . .
11542|1|Let me start off my review by posing a simple question : WHY IN THE HELL HAS THIS MOVIE BEEN CONSIDERED A COMEDY CLASSIC FOR 25 FREAKIN' YEARS ? ! All the so-called humor in this movie consists of sex and d * * k jokes , none of which rise above the kind of thing I heard in high school . Don't get me wrong , I'm not a prude , and I can very much enjoy raunchy sexual humor when it's done well , but I couldn't belive how wholly unfunny " Porky's " was . It was entertaining in a way- I wasn't bored by it- but aside from one or two moments that made me chuckle , there just wasn't anything funny about it . Why this has become a cult favorite and is regarded as a classic 80s comedy , I'll never know . If you want to see a genuinely funny movie from this era , try " National Lampoon's Vacation " and skip this crap .
11544|1|It was terrible back when it first came out and hasn't aged well . Stupid potty jokes and sexual humour . THis flick is childish and immaute and just plain dumb . I am sorry I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this crap .
11557|1|Hated this one .
11569|1|The Tailor of Panama , a spy story set in Panama after the ousting of Manuel Noriega , is a really bad movie . My husband and I saw it yesterday , and we both agreed that it deserved no more than one star . The plot is ridiculous , and the acting is terrible . Pierce Brosnan's character , a really sleazy James Bond wannabe , was a huge disappointment . I don't recommend watching this movie , even when it comes out on television . Two thumbs way down !
11576|1|This became the number one movie ? ? ? ? How utterly embarrasing . The thing which I will only refer to as The Donkey Show should be burned . This movie promotes destruction of property , brainlessness , profanity use and disrespect for the parental bring-up . And , to make things even worse , it had to have over an hour cut out just to make it R-rated . Gross , crude , lewd and appealing to the lowest common denominator , boycott this and see another great movie that is family-friendly instead ! And , as for JKooks , I haven't used a profane word in almost seven years and consider myself quite cool , regardless .
11579|1|I wish I could have my hour and a half back .
11590|1|Other than seeing that purty little Ashley Judd , in bikini panties , jumping 10 feet in the air , the movie was stankonian and about as funny as Jet Li delivering a stiff kick to my testicles .
11613|1|To be honest , I haven't actually seen it . But I have read reviews saying that they modernized it ( e . g . Gwendolyn gets a tattoo ) and ommited many of the funny parts of the play . I loved the play , thought it was extremely clever , funny and witty , and I consider Oscar Wilde a comic genius for it . But this new movie version apparently is a disgrace to the play and I don't intend to see it ! ) : 0 (
11616|1|this is not a great tom hanks movie .
11625|1|I'd have much more fun doing my laundry . A complete waste of time . . . and talent . Talent ? Oh yeah . . . there is none ! Avoid at all costs .
11627|1|This film is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen . Every time I think about this movie . . . my intelligence drops . If I was a 15 year old kid on dope this would be funny , but I am not . . . so it stinks .
11641|1|I have never left a movie during the first hour until this ! Terrible !
11660|1|Totally brain dead !
11664|1|It was a peice of crap movie with that weird anemic looking kid- who im sure was a dork in high school .
11669|1|I didn't like this film very much ! ! ! It was TOO disgusting ! ! ! Also the storyline was RIDICULOUS ! ! ! But also realistic ! ! ! This was worse than Ren and Stimpy . Here are the gross parts : Drew's character Nancy eats a raison with Lysol sprayed on it , Ms . Connelly chokes on a chocolate , and spits it out on Nancy's forehead , the scene where Ben's character Alex is fixing the sink pipe , and Nancy accidently swallows the tained water , and barfs in Alex's face , and when they get the flu and cough on popcorn in a bowl ! ! ! DISGUSTING ! ! ! ! !
11676|1|This movie was so horrible I am embarrassed that I spent 90 minutes watching it . Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are out of control . . . why would any one hire a hit man to kill an old lady ? ? Why would any one even try to kill an old lady ? ? The whole time I was watching it I wanted to tell them both to get control of themselves . They were both acting like lunatics simply because this old lady was annoying them ? Sorry , but thats not funny . Its stupid .
11683|1|APPALLING movie . I doubt you can call it a comedy in the first place .
11703|1|Essentially , it boils down to two 30 year old children getting into a fight over a parking space . The only good part was when Joe came to his senses . I expected more from Tim Allen .
11705|1|Bad movie .
11716|1|You have to wonder about Gwyneth Paltrow's state of mind when she read this script and agreed to do the movie . Maybe she owed someone a favor .
11723|1|A View From The Top is possibly the biggest waste of a cast in the history of the film industry . Gwenyth Paltrow , Christina Applegate , Rob Lowe , Mike Myers , and Candice Bergen form out possibly the best , yet somehow the worst cast in film history . It just doesn't work . Paltrow and Applegate occasionally have chemistry , but that isn't enough to make up for the fact that the characters are one-dimensional cartoons living in another world . Mike Myers and Rob Lowe give cameo performances , while Candice Bergen shouldn't have anything to do with this .
11730|1|After seeing Bring it On , I couldn't imagine a teen movie being any worse . I was proven wrong by this dreck . I honestly don't think I laughed a single time in this horrible movie . Too much profanity , disrespectful attitudes , sterotypes , illegal acts being glorfied and in the end , well , it shouldn't have ended that way . This is why I tape high-quality TV ( Frasier , Cosby Show , Happy Days ) more than modern comedy movies . For a movie called Sugar Spice , there isn't much sweet about this movie .
11734|1|Rather dumb . . . I dunno , I'm just not a chick-flick person .
11740|1|thumbs down
11759|1|Yes , let us not have another , please !
11761|1|Not even funny , the spoofing is obvious and overdone .
11763|1|I have not seen a film this terrible since I Still Know What You Did Last Summer . This film is horrid . Absolutly terrible . The spoofing makes no sense and it way too fixated on placing sh * t on people . Whether it is talking about pooping on someone for sexual plaeasur or actually exploding gallons of fresh sh * t all over people . Where does all the sh * t come from ? This was never in The Breakfast Club or She's All That . I felt like I had flushed my hard earned bucks down the toilet and then had it explode all over me with sh * t . The only true moment of comedy comes with . . . jesus . . . . there are no funny moments . I had to force my laughter each time something was supposed to be comical . What a waste of a good genre to spoof .
11771|1|I must give this movie the 1 star because it commits the greatest sin a movie can . It's boring . Apart from an occasional South Park style laugh , this film has no point except to make fun of something without telling you why . Once you get over the novelty of puppets trying to walk you may find yourself staring at the wall beside you wondering how much better your life could have been had you not gone to this film .
11775|1|Started well and some very funny parts . . . by the middle it was getting less of a spoof and more partisan . By the end I thought it had greatly deteriorated . Fans of South Park might like it but it will find limited audiences overseas where they might not get the satire . ( obviously ) All my American friends I saw it with were rather embarrassed by it .
11777|1|I did not see this movie and with Dick Dirk's review now read I know I do not desire to , even though in the use of his delicate rhetoric I believe he said he did enjoy it .
11783|1|i've seen better .
11788|1|Stupid . An unsucessful attempt at a parody . I'm just glad I wasn't one of the people that actually paid to see this . But that didn't keep me from wanting the time that I wasted watching it back or the brain cells that I lost while watching it .
11802|1|This movie stinks , its pretentious arty fartsy crap ! ! Avoid it at all cost .
11805|1|couldn't wait to leave this movie .
11808|1|One of the most crapy films i have ever seen . the only reason i watched it was because there was nothing else on and i regret it
11813|1|Ok . . . now let's add this to our Top 10 . . . . worst movies of all time .
11814|1|I found this film to be a disappointment . This is measured not only in MY view of the film , but also that of my two daughters who found it quite lackluster . There was entirely too much adult ( sex ) humour for a film directed at kids . I personally don't care for the lowest common denominator humour : gee , the bear has gas and his poop stinks . Har Har Har . It was bad enough directing away question about what is oral sex thanks to Bill Clinton , now I have a kid asking what an Action Shot is . I guess after Klumps I should have known what to expect ; heck , from Eddie's early comedy act I should have known what to expect . The movie is slow , the humour is weak , and the there is nothing that makes you really care what happens . Sorry , Baaaaad movie .
11817|1|Should be called Intolerable Boredom . Me and the missus fell asleep through large portions of it . It's a comedy devoid of humor -- and a very mean spirited one at that . One of the worst offerings ever by the brothers Coen .
11819|1|This affront to the ocular palette should be burned before viewing . If you like the Coen brothers , then maybe you'll find some amusement here . However , if you enjoy well done movies with a good plot , acting and cinematography , then this is not the place to go . The only saving grace was Katherine .
11820|1|Just too sad .
11823|1|because of the titland scene
11828|1|Totally lame ! I can't believe they bothered to make this movie .
11831|1|Bad Hollywood remake off of the cartoon .
11832|1|one of the worst movies i've ever seen
11843|1|Comedy , no . Accurate representation of karaoke subculture , no way . Well-written , ixnay . Engaging , only the storyline about the man who quits his job and goes crazy ; but - it went down the tubes and the promise was broken .
11852|1|lousy movie i didn't find it funny at all
11853|1|OMG , could you have made a worse movie ? Who's idea was this ? Why ? ? ? ? ?
11856|1|Unless you enjoy watching a grumpy , drunk , jerk say the f word every 5 minutes , then I do not recommend this movie . Billy Bob plays such a miserable character it makes the movie painful to watch . Then in the last scene when he tries to redeem himself its too little too late , and seems way too unlikely that such a loser would FINALLY develope any sort of compassion . Dont waste your time .
11862|1|I am not offended by much . . . just bad movies ! This movie sucked ! I was soooo prepared to laugh . The laugh was on me ! ! Bad , bad , movie .
11863|1|Does anyone remember children ? Yes I realize this is an Adult movie , but those ubiquitous ads are seen by children all day long . In this age of absent parenting and single mothers de jour , Go pop some Adults bubble leaves the kids alone !
11868|1|Compared to the first one I think this movie was just aweful . Even by itself it's still annoying . The pacing was WAY too fast and the humor was way too obnoxious . The first one at least was somewhere in the vicinity of trying to be believable . When I went to the movie , I thought she was gonna be running for office - that I think woulda been a better story idea , where she's in the next phase of her life , tackling obstacles and fighting battles at the next level of tests in maturity . But no , they basically did a repeat of the first one , where she goes to a new place where her sorority-mad perkiness is scoffed at and eventually accepted through her hard work and good-heartedness . In a word , it was lame .
11872|1|Dumbest movie ever released with a bunch of stupid stereo types . If your IQ is low you are gonna love this show .
11888|1|Just awful ! Has Danny DeVito ever made a satisfying movie ? Characters totally unbelievable , and Robin ( who I like ) having a total character reversal at the end after going in circles throughout the whole movie ( I'll kill him ! I'll kill him ! Oh , now I love him ! Pleeeze ! ) Liked Norton , but what was the deal with Jon Stewart ? And what's the point of all the vulgarity ? I'm not a prude , but it's not funny anymore . And any 'comedy' that you can count the number of laughs ( two ) has a problem . Not even worthy of Blockbusters leftover table .
11892|1|This movie was totally gross , and filled with so much filth that I could barely watch until the ending . I thought the Prince Albert scene was repulsive as well . Save your time and money and don't ever watch this piece of trash if you know what is good for you . . . . . I was totally shocked that Christina Applegate would have chose such a role . . . .
11901|1|Bad sequel to overrated movie . Disney should be ashamed . Shameless Raven cameo .
11902|1|omg why is this even here , they should have held the premiere at a BlockBuster
11913|1|Uninteresting , unfunny , and unwatchable movie .
11933|1|this was a comedy ? ? ? wow , must have missed that . . .
11941|1|Third-rate remake of a truly great original movie . Tom Hanks put in his usual unconvincing performance , and in this case , that bogus Southern accent he tortured the audience with was really annoying . Crass , broad , vulgar attempt at humor . Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness must be thrashing about wildly in their tombs .
11945|1|Jennifer Aniston STILL sucks .
11946|1|Very funny bit by Hank Azaria as the French scuba instructor . . and Jennifer Aniston fine . Otherwise this thing reeks . Someone should stop Ben Stiller from making movies .
11947|1|It was so frikin predictable ! there were only a few mildly amusing moments . three words people : oh dear god !
11960|1|Kate Hudson STILL sucks .
11967|1|Will Ferrell is one of the worst actors to ever come out of SNL , and this movie proves this once again . The script of this movie proves to be very lame , and I did not find one scene remotely funny .
11971|1|Stinker . The Scream series does a much better job at satirizing the horror genre . Scary movie 2 ( or 1 , or 3 for that matter ) , in essence a satire of a satire , has all groaners and very few chuckles . Very raunchy too ,
11978|1|One word : obscene ! I'm not a puritan , but I thought the sex jokes were revolting . Imagine that in Italy it's rated G . . . . and parents will rent it for their 10-year-old children . The problem is , it isn't even funny at all . . .
11984|1|What was the climax of this stupid movie . Where Jason Biggs says the F word to shock the 9 years olds that were watching it ? Or was it when Jason Biggs punches that dude in the library and then becomes this hero guy . This movie was definately aimed at 8-11 year olds so they can brag to there friends that they saw a PG-13 movie . It terribly falls flat . No jokes ( or at least good ones ) , nothing new . Blah .
11989|1|Horrible casting . None of them could have ever been losers because the look too pretty . Plot stunk like rotting flesh . Best scene is the dream sequence in the credits .
11990|1|Loser was a bad movie . I was glad to go home . It was slow and not funny at all . I hate this film with a passion .
12009|1|Vin Diesel needs to be deported .
 1201|1|It is just boring .
12014|1|Adam Sandler sucks !
12016|1|I am a huge Adam Sandler fan , which is why I went to see this movie . However , I was terribly disappointed at the gross stupidity of this movie . It was not even one those movies that is so stupid it's funny . The humor was disgusting and definately a poor representation of Adam Sandler's talent as an actor and producer . I would have given this film a rating of 0 if it were an option .
12020|1|? ? ? ? ?
12022|1|Movies like this should not even be allowed to be maid . Weed that makes you smarter . Sorry , but that point wouldn't even escape Snoop after 40 blunts .
12026|1|Somebody shoot the producer of this sh * t .
12027|1|'Kay , very possibly one of the stupidest movies I have EVER seen . It wasn't even stupid like it was funny stupid , just stupid . I just sat there , for two hours literally feeling my brain go numb from the pointless tatoo banter and stoned guys trying to have some sort of coherent conversation and failing miserably .
12029|1|Ashton Kutcher . That explains everything . I still like the and then thing but he can take no credit for that .
12032|1|Worst movie ever .
12033|1|The worst movie I've ever seen ( though parts of the trailer were funny ) .
12034|1|I'm a fan of Ashton Kutcher and even I couldn't stomach this idiocy . What was wrose was how many inane catchphrases it created . A waste of film reel with nothing redeemable about it .
12039|1|Are you kidding me ? lol ! This thing should be in the $ 1 . 00 bargain bin at Blockbuster . Get real .
12042|1|dude wheres the dumb
12043|1|I went to a free advanced screening of this film , and I was still tempted to walk out after the first 10 minutes and demand a refund . A movie ad-libbed by a class of 3rd graders would have been more entertaining , and one would at least have been able to understand where the writers were coming from . The whole plot of this movie revolves around two moronic stoners trying to figure out what happened to them the previous night ; they can't remember because they were incredibly high and wasted and stupid . I can only assume the film makers went through this exact process after they woke up and found out they had produced this abomination . Even people ( including myself ) who enjoy movies that are So Stupid , They're Funny will find themselves nauseated and insulted after even brief exposure to this comedic black hole . I hope that those responsible for inflicting the world with Dude , Where's My Car ? are very , very sorry . And poor . And covered with honey and fire ants .
12049|1|i frigging hated it . i expected total hiliarity , but i think i maybe laughed once . . . then again , it could have been gas . the story line was weak at best and i kicked myself for actually paying the money to rent it .
12057|1|I personally thought this movie was absolutly pathetic . The only way you can enjoy this movie is to be stoned . The movie is about losing a car on a night of being trashed and on the trip to retrievel they stumble upon clues of what they did last night . Who really cares about where thier car is . I can't believe I even payed to see this movie . Someone shoot me ! I think the whole time i laughed once . They ruined every joke by out doing themselves , too much stupid acting for simple little jokes .
12064|1|Incredibly stupid movie . I can't believe anyone would pay to see this , let alone believe anyone would get paid to make crap like this . About fifteen minutes was all I could take . Usually I can make myself sit through a movie like this , but even I have my limits . Complete waste of time .
12065|1|How Ed Asner decided to do this movie , I'll never know . But , aside from that , it's stupid , disrespectful and of course , sick at times . Avoid .
12069|1|Crappy and totally unfunny comedy .
12072|1|Foolish , ignorant and totally horrible . What was the budget on this film , 100k ? How long did it take the writers to come up with this crap ?
12074|1|What a piece of crap made for the amusement of people who have a low enough IQ to appreciate . It was bad enough when they made the first one now there are two sequals . The next one I want to see made would be the Last Friday .
12075|1|Definitely should've stopped with the first one . This one was just dreadful , and the next sequel Friday After the Friday After Next will probably be just as bad .
12079|1|A waste of time .
12081|1|Pathetic follow up film for Gere and Roberts . Not that Pretty Woman was any good , itself . . .
12090|1|Pathetic .
12101|1|I never saw this movie but the stupid plot and a stupid title say it all , don't see it , it's stupid .
12114|1|I Hate The Movie
12116|1|for the wovie in history in my opinion has to be a tie between this movie and mr maggoo anybody agree ?
12118|1|Possibly the worst piece of crap ever made . Some of Adam Sandler's movies are funny , such as Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy , but this movie was ridiculous .
12134|1|Chris Rock is the lead actor in the film . Nuff said .
12141|1|Perhaps one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen .
12144|1|Chris Kattan SUCKS .
12154|1|what ? ! i want BATTLEFIELD EARTH TWO . NOT THIS .
12155|1|This movie was absolutely terrible . Whatever you do , don't waste your money on this junk ! !
12163|1|I know Garfield and this isn't it . It's just a boring , generic , anaemic kids movie . Garfield looks like c * * * , most of the acting is poor ( especially Jennifer Love Hewitt , who acts so forced ) and the plot is not true to the comic . For example , Garfield hates Odie . He doesn't become friends with him like he does here . Liz also hates Jon . Any date they went on in the comic strip was a disaster . Here , they like each other . The only acceptable performance is from Bill Murray as Garfield . The villain is generic kiddy c * * * I've seen a thousand times over , and is acted out as such . The rescue is both unoriginal and unexciting . The rest of the animals are just normal animals , which looks kind of cheap and they are only related to the comic by name ( for example , Arlene doesn't appear to be Garfield's girlfriend ) . In conclusion , if you're a Garfield fan , don't see this . Garfield : The Movie could have been interesting to watch , but it just isn't . I like the comic . I hate this movie . 1 / 5 stars - You've been warned
12166|1|I didn't actually sit down for this movie , but working at a theater , I saw enough of it . I refuse to reward Jim Davis' next effort to over-commercialize his characters and grab more money with more than one star . I mean , the Garfield comic's storyline isn't complicated . Would it have been so difficult to stay true to it ? Nermal is a cute , gray kitten . Arlene is tall and white . And having Liz give in to Jon's affections completely butchers the personalities of both characters . And would it have been so tough for ALL the animal characters to be CGI , and not just Garfield ?
12170|1|This has got to be the ABSOLUTE WORST movie I have EVER seen ! ! ! ! I could not believe the producers would put out something this awful . There was none of that humor that makes the Garfield comic strips so funny . No kicking the crap out of Odie , no humorous jokes about Jon , no nothing . This movie lacked substance , it really did . I would rather have lost the $ 8 . 50 I spent on the ticket on the streets somewhere rather than sit for an hour and half forced to watch this mess because I don't like to waste money . I hated this film ! ! ! The least they could have done was make Odie animated as well then maybe they could have done some of funny things they're known for doing to each other . But , you could tell that this sh * t was low-budget . The acting was terrible , the set was terrible , the cast was terrible , the plot ridiculous ( Odie gets kidnapped by a TV show host because he can dance and the guy wants him for a co-host and Garfield sets out to rescue him ) . At the end Jon ends up with Liz the vet . Now that would never happen in the actual comic strip . STUPID ! ! ! I am really ranting here but I am actually a big fan of the comic strip , I own several books full of them , I've bought posters , the works so I feel I can really be a critic here . This movie did not represent what Garfield is really about at all . It was pathetic . The End .
12171|1|Another attempt at a Bret Easton Ellis novel being made into a movie , and yet another failure . Why can't they find a good director , screen writer , or even producers to make one of his books into a movie that is actually worth watching ? It is a complete travesty , and I find it very surprising that Bret would allow his books to be butchered so massively without any care in the world . I almost cried by how horrible this movie was . . . . you would be better off reading the novel , trust me .
12174|1|This movie was just plain stupid . It was the worst movie I have ever seen . Just plain insipid and moronic . Don't waste your time , People . It's not a good movie .
12186|1|If your not going to get Jim Carrey or Jeff Daniels , then don't make the movie . There also was WAY to much of a storyline .
12199|1|Was this REALLY necessary ?
12201|1|This movie should have never been made . It gaves Harry and Lloyd a bad name .
12203|1|Please take away the pain . .
12205|1|I had to be dragged into the theater to see this one . I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece or anything , but did it HAVE to be that painfully bad ? The first one was better ( and that's not saying much , obviously ) . The jokes were lame ( again , not that I was expecting much ) , the storyline was terrible , it was just BAD . The movie lives up to its title all right , so I guess it's not false advertising , at least .
12206|1|Brittany Murphy SUCKS .
 1221|1|I like a film that makes some sense - this did not ! !
12213|1|Trash . Waste of money , time and space . Period . Martin Lawrence is a sitcom actor only . His series was funny , very funny . But his acting in practically all of his movies has been pretty terrible to me . I do like him though , just not in movies .
12214|1|The worst movie ever . Lawerence can't act , period .
12216|1|The best I can figure out for this barrel of offal is that the Wayans brothers wanted a vehicle to poke fun at white people's sensitilities and to play off against various stereotypes . This is strictly fare for morons and cretins ; but hey , they need their entertainment also !
12222|1|Shockingly bad . I went in with high expectations and left wanting to sue the theater for my money back . I realize the support cast carried Romano on Everybody Loves Raymond , but you really get the feeling of how much of a dud he is when you suffer through this flick .
12224|1|Freebird is right about one thing ; I am glad I only rented this . Very boring , and extremely disorganized . Ray Romano's comic talents quickly gave way to a poorly written script , and extremely cliched jokes about politicians . I didn't even know which one to route for in that election ; neither one seemed any better or worse than the other .
12227|1|Cynical tripe .
12229|1|Did anyone actually go to the theater to see this dreck ? If so , they need therapy . I saw it on cable and it appears to be some kind of spin-off from Rock's HBO gig . Dreadful !
12230|1|America is totally f * * * ked when sh * t like this is produced for mass consumption .
12234|1|Wonderful heart warming family film . You'll laugh , you'll cry . You'll want you'r f * cking money back ! ! WHAT A STINKY PIECE ! ! ! ! !
12248|1|Walking into this mess .
12251|1|Oh Lord , this was bad . The only thing that would have made it worse is having Sandler , Schneider or Carrey in the cast .
12254|1|Well , I have one thing to say . This movie sucked .
12255|1|Kangaroo Jack is one of those horrible films that is the perfect candidate for the Raspberry Awards . It's horrid to see these two hasbeen actors as a bunch of drunk buddies . It's always nice to see Christopher Walken , but he has no material to work with . The Kangaroo does not talk , with the exception of a long and obnoxious dream sequence which is an excuse to put the move over 80 minutes long .
12256|1|The worst movie of all time . It's so bad that it's not even funny . What idiot decided to spend money to make this piece of crap ?
12257|1|Are you kidding ? Is this drivel a movie ? I watched ten minutes of this crap at my son-in-laws house , before I got up and went into another room . Tom Greene should be put away forever for being a total moron .
12263|1|Absolutely disgusting movie . It's a total gross-out with no plot whatsoever .
12265|1|Marrying Drew Barrymore did not help his movie career .
12268|1|I WAS GENIOUS WITH THIS RATING BECAUSE I COULDNT GIVE THIS 0 STARS . AWFUL DISGUSTING MOVIE . I SNUCK IN TO THIS MOVIE AND I STILL WANTED MY MOVIE BACK . TOM GREEN STICK TO PISSING OFF PEOPLE ON THE STREET .
12269|1|I haven't seen this but I was told that the message you get at the end is The joke is on you for paying to see this movie ! Good one Tom . . . . I guess .
12272|1|Barbershop 3 : Give It Up
12274|1|One was enough ! Please stop !
12279|1|Who are these apologists ? The critics were right to trash this dog of a movie .
12282|1|This was a comedy ? I guess the joke was getting a studio to front the money for this wretched garbage .
12284|1|This stinker was so far below Dustin Hoffman it is hard to imagine WHAT he was thinking when he agreed to take the part . Beatty , on the other hand , is another story entirely . This film is only slightly above Plan 9 from Outer Space - and , in Ed Wood's defense , at least he had the excuse of a low budget .
12285|1|this is a ZERO , period . . . . no further comment , exxcept i have a bridge in brooklyn for the producer who fell for this pathetic carcature of a script . . .
12288|1|This should have come with a warning . No IQ's over 80 permitted .
12290|1|This movie is absolutely awful . It deserves no stars . Truly , it sucks !
12291|1|Another Tom Green movie that I will never see . Who watches this crap and why do the studios keep giving people money to make movies with Tom Green . The local paper also gave this one no stars and if I could I would . Note to Hollywood send Tom back to Canada .
12303|1|Way too far fetched . The judge had a roller coaster in his back yard , enough said .
12305|1|Nothing this man spits out can be mistakened as comedy . . this isn't an exception .
12308|1|Extremely terrible movie is what describes 'Soul Plane' . It was not only because of the lack of a real plot , nor was it the fact that the cast could not act if their lives depended on it ; it was the fact that the movie was plain DUMB . It was not funny , whatsoever . And everyone ought to be insulted by this horrific piece of trash as it plays to the worst possible stereotypes often attributed to minorities , especially African Americans . This was an embarrassment to all of moviedom . Period .
12309|1|How this ever got to the theaters is beyond me . No bankable stars and a stupid plot . Black movies were set back by this garbage .
12310|1|Not even worth being on this list . While I am here anyway , it gets two thumbs way down and a fat 1 ! ! !
 1232|1|Absolutely terrible movie . Retched . Not worth anything at all .
12437|1|What a stupid idea for a movie .
 1245|1|this sucked donkey balls
12469|1|I don't understand why they felt they had to make this again when it has already been made memorable in Gene Wilder's film . And a classic version it was too .
 1247|1|Although I am the biggest John Travolta fan who ever lived , I hated this movie so much ! I didn't understand any of it and I thought John's look was a disgrace to the magnificent handsome face God gave him ! I only enjoyed ONE part of that movie and that was when he was dancing with Uma . I can't say the acting was bad by any of the actors , but it was the story that was just way beyond my understanding . . . however I know I am in the minority because of all the people I've ever talked to , they all enjoyed this movie very much !
12520|1|Please e-mail me with suggestions , stories , or lies to help me get out of taking my wife to see this movie . . . she's already mentioned it and I need an escape plan . HURRY !
12526|1|More special fx and fantasy tosh . . . isn't Hollywood fed up with all this vacuity yet ? So it brings in the dollars . . . but let's get some warming , real-life stories !
12532|1|Unless you need to take kids to a relatively clean movie , I would avoid Kicking and Screaming . I'm told it's a comedy but I didn't laugh . I almost walked out of the theater 20 minutes into the movie because it was so boring . Unfortunately I stayed and the movie never got any better . Save your money and see something , anything , else .
12538|1|Jeesus H . Christ , I hated this movie . It's been a long time since I wanted to walk out on a film within the first fifteen minutes . Wait a minute . . . no it hasn't . There was " The Constant Gardener " . Yuck . Anyway , back to the turd in question . The storyline had one gimmick . A good premise , that went nowhere . So , the story sucked , but it wasn't the worst thing about this film . The worst thing about this film was the MILF . Every second she was on screen was one more second that I seriously contemplated a mad dash for the door . She was plain awful . Her overly melodramatic , shrewlike , smarmy dialouge was bad enough . I'll give her credit for a decent performance . It wasn't her fault that the casting director , film director and screenwriter sucked . She seemed to be a good actress , but I guess it's hard to act your way out of a bad movie . I wouldn't know . In fact , I don't know a damn thing about making movies , except that I know a bad one when I see it . Anyway , I simply didn't buy the idea that this movie " mom " had a sixteen year old son , a five year old daughter and hips like a seventeen year old girl . Needless to say , her makeup & hair were always perfect . Yeah , right . Major pet peeves of mine . I'm sick of Hollywood's version of regular folks who look as though they stepped out of a Spiegel catalog . Seriously , the only time I enjoyed her performance was when she flashed the beaver . . . but , ummm I gotta ask , just what the hell WAS that all about ? Hey , I'm into 69'ing cheerleaders and rough sex on the stairway , but I wasn't expecting to see either one in this particular movie . At least , not where the director put them , not from those angles , not for that long and not set to a " Tender Moments " soundtrack . Hot scenes , I guess , but besides being out of place they went on tooooo long . And that MUSIC . Aaaarghhhh ! I mean , if I'm watching people bump and grind I expect some bowmp-ba-bowmp or screetching guitars or Bolero or anything but that sappy Hallmark Movie of the Week , elevator music . God , this movie sucked . Just sucked . I need a drink .
 1254|1|Mindless and very boring movie that really goes nowhere very quickly .
12554|1|I only went to see that nasty skank die . . . ( ( Paris ) )
12573|1|Erf , me and my boyfriend went to this movie just to make out , seeing as it was soo boring . .
12580|1|I was bored , looking for a quick laugh . I didn't find any laughs with this movie . Recycled plots , poor direction . And the cinema had a 15 minute rule . If you walk out in the first 15 minutes you get your money back . I didn't know this . I walked out after about 20 minutes of this movie . Don't waste your time or money with the Kranks . . .
12589|1|Jennifer Lopez STILL sucks .
12591|1|Another victim to the Hollywood remake trend . Charlize Theorn made an awful Aeon Flux . The costume is the worst . I prefer the cartoon over the movie remake .
12596|1|I fell asleep while watching this
12601|1|It's a waste of money . I thought it was gonna be good cause of the famous voices for the animals boy was I wrong , the audience only laughed once and it wasn't a fall of the chair laugh just a simple ha ha . I warned ya .
12612|1|I can't believe they dragged out Krik Douglas' corpse to make a few bucks . Shame on them .
12616|1|Well , it was a good start to the new Brangelina movement . They got to make out in a movie , and not feel extremely guilty about it . It was all scripted . . . or so we think .
12620|1|Hated it .
12621|1|Doesn't matter who Angelina's currently spreading her legs for in Hollywood . . . she STILL sucks .
12622|1|Unfortunately , a complete disappointment . I have been a fan for years but this just didn't work . . . I felt I was watching a differnt film entirely . Why change a successful format ?
12625|1|Ouch . Painful ! Allowing myself to be dragged to see this at the THEATER is on my top ten lists of regrets . In fact , my tombstone will probably read : " One regret " Dr . Kryptic , I'm assuming there were no parachutes on board .
12629|1|Despite the fact that I watched this movie on a flight from Boston to SFO , this movie was so bad I still thought about walking out on it . I used to like Will Farrell , but now after 29 movies over three years it has become apparent how one-dimensional and unoriginal he really is . He's the same character in every movie , and most recently they have all been bad movies . Nicole Kidman was at least a little ( very little ) likable in the movie , but she drops in my opinion -- guilt by association . What was she thinking taking on this role ? This was one of the worst movies ever .
12641|1|My word to describe this movie : UNNECESSARY . Between what is truly entertaining and what is a pure waste of time , there is a line . Kinsey crossed it . Definitely a waste of time . I was interested at first because of the sweet honest romance Kinsey and his wife shared and their naivity about sex . It was cute . But the remainder of the movie took a beautiful thing and shat ( is that a word ? ) all over it . My image of Lliam Neeson is forever ruined .
12645|1|. . . this is one of those ones where you're gonna either love it or hate it . I'm in the latter camp . Okay , so I haven't seen Rob Zombie's previous move , House of 1000 Corpses ; I did figure , Yeah , this is probably going to be a little bizarre , violent , whatever , I can deal with that . . Besides , my husband really wanted to see it . He's the type who likes that bizarre stuff . I can deal with violence . But I don't appreciate POINTLESS violence much . I mean , really , there wasn't really much of a plot : Crazy possibly-imbred psycho family gets hunted down by equally psychotic sheriff . Yeah , whatever . If you're fairly sensitive to depictions of sexual violence , yeah , this movie DEFINATELY isn't for you . It was just one scene , but I seriously actually wanted to vomit . ( Which is a feat , there's only one other movie that made me want to throw up ; this movie also has the distinction of being one of the few that I've actually wanted to walk out of ) . And , what's worse , people in the theater were LAUGHING . WTF ? I don't know what I was disgusted at more , the movie or the people in the theater . Okay , so that's my fault ; I should've done some research before walking into the theater , I'll take full responsibility for that one . I don't really care if this movie pushed the extremes on violence , nudity , and profanity : yeah , it's never been done before , but it doesn't make it GOOD . If you're okay with all that , go ahead and buy the DVD , knock yourself out . At least I know better now to skip any future Rob Zombie flicks .
12657|1|dissapointing
12658|1|This movie failed on all levels with me . First of all , if you've seen The Ring , nothing in this movie will surprise you . Samara isn't nearly as scary in this one as in the first one . It was far to easy to tell when it was Aiden , or Samara in the possession scenes , and I didn't think Rachel's acting was particularly good at any point in the movie . The special effects in this film are pretty much what you got in the first one , no surprises there . There are two good effects moments , though . The deer attacking the car ( Why didn't Rachel just listen to Aiden and keep driving ? ) and the bathtub scene ( Why didn't Rachel listen to Aiden when he said he didn't want to take a bath ? ) . Those two scenes were the highlight of an otherwise dull and unremarkable film . Skip it .
12660|1|1 star . . . in honor of the first Chucky . BUT . . . why anyone would think that he needs descendants is beyond me .
12662|1|Doesn't live up to the trailer . Not at all scary . Don't waste your money , skip this one .
12666|1|Paris Hilton in the movie ? That's pathetic ! Those who have seen the movie and loved it should be ashamed of yourselves . Hollywood brought into a new low BIG TIME !
 1267|1|Pulp Fiction was in a word , brainless . Aside from the FAR to over used gore and shock factor , there was no point to this film . I left the theater feeling not only stupider for having seen this film , but I also wasted $ 7 . 50 to see it .
12671|1|If there were a marking for zero , I would definatley put it down . As a fan of the show , I'm a little insulted . This movie was incredibly lame and Jessica Simpson made a horrible Daisy Duke .
12676|1|Sandler was great in Punh Drunk Love , but in this one he is just there to get a few extra people in to pay thier money .
12679|1|Is 'Superbabies : Baby Geniuses 2' stupid ? YES ! Perhaps the stupidest film to come out in a long time , the idiots who gave the go to make a sequel out of the originally lame 'Baby Genuises' ought to be tarred and feathered for wasting millions of dollars on such worthlessness . This movie , like its predecessor , has no humor- nor does it have any real meaning to it . This movie , in short , is a disgrace almost as bad as the total failure of moviedom from years back : 'The Jerky Boys Movie' . Perhaps the only positive thing about this movie is that it can't possibly be as bad as 'The Jerky Boys Movie' . But it comes fairly close .
 1268|1|I hated this movie because it didn't' make sense and was disgusting . I couldn't bare to watch that crap especially when the guy is getting screwed up the ass ! I turned the movie off . All the cutting and jumping from time to time didn't make sense .
12680|1|More like Stupid Babies : Baby Geniuses 2 . How did this movie get the greenlight ?
12681|1|Let's do the math . . . . . Tara Reid + Christian Slater = ? ? ?
12683|1|I just saw an advance screening of this in Toronto , and I have to say it is without a doubt one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen . While I enjoyed XXX and found the Fast and the Furious moderately entertaining for a rental , I have to say that Rob Cohen has just proved himself as having one of the worst eyes for detail in the world . . . that or he simply does not have any other skill except pointing the camera and shooting . The first 15 minutes of the film shows good promise . It starts off with a bang and gives you some of the coolest fighter jet action ever . And in terms of the jet sequences , they are certainly some of the best I have ever seen . But that is the only saving grace of this film . If all you care about are the fighter sequences , you will probably enjoy this . But , if you have any brain for real military situations , science or even common sense , you will find this film to be about the stupidest piece of tripe you have every laid your eyes on . To give one example , at one point a pilot has to bail out of a plane ( this is shown in the commercials ) . Any person with a brain would know that if a pilot bailed out , in a few seconds that pilot's plane would be nearly a mile away . However , this pilot ejects downwards and a few seconds later the plane blows up raining fiery debris over the pilot . Any person with a basic understanding of science would know that the heavy , metallic debris from the plane would be traveling faster in its original direction than the falling pilot , and since the plane did not blow up instantly , it would not be directly above the pilot . However , the debris falls in a straight line down onto the pilot . Another example is the fact that there are so many minor plot threads that have absolutely no importance to the overall story . It is like the writer needed to fill space instead of developing the original story and decided to just throw in a bunch of unrelated , undeveloped scenes . Instead of developing the main story ( which was interesting enough ) we get a bunch of little threads that never add up to a very interesting whole . These are just two examples of how badly thought out the script was . The list is actually endless and my friend and I spent the second half of the film just carving it up . Jamie Foxx is going to be thanking the Maker that he won the Oscar before this film was released . At least he can still ride on that success . However , there is not much for anybody else involved in this film to walk away with . Don't waste your money . If you want to see it , rent it . But there are much better films to spend money on . I'm glad I didn't spend a cent .
12684|1|Where to begin ? Dark Water looks like a fun , scary , summer movie from every trailer that is shown , and I admit that I looked forward to seeing it . But now that I have sat down and taken the hours out of my life to watch the film , I feel like I have wasted a part of my life for this movie . To be frank , Dark Water is a boring , and un-scary film . I thought of this movie as being along the lines ( in scares and suspense ) of the remake of The Ring , but I found myself disappointed in what I watched take place on screen . I'm not sure if it's just me , but dirty water gushing out of a faucet every 5 min . is not what I call scary . Obviously I did not like this movie , and nearly the entire theater who saw the film with me felt the same way . Many people immediately got on their cell phones and called others saying how bad it was , and one woman said to her ( husband I'm presuming ) that she felt that she had been ripped off , even though it was a free screening . From what is shown in the trailers ( panic , glass breaking , and water gushing out in every direction ) , all of that happens within the final 15 or 10 min . of the movie . What is worse is that the first hour or so is so dull and boring that you loose interest almost completely by the time the , do I dare say , fun , events occur . In the beginning , Dark Water seems to be a slow paced , and sad drama . Not at all a scary / suspenseful thriller . The ending is bizarre , and pointless . The mystery of what happens is unclearly solved and we are left thinking what just happened ? . The director takes his time setting up the movie ( drawing out divorce , custody hearings , looking through the apartment for a good 20 min . , walking around the halls , riding in the elevator , going to school , among many other things ) , and then when you finally care about what is happening , it is like he slams the book shut and leaves you disappointed . At one time I looked forward to seeing Dark Water beat the Fantastic 4 at the box office , because the Fantastic 4 looked even worse from previews , interviews and trailers , but now . . . now after seeing Dark Water in its entirety , I have to say to everyone wondering how Dark Water really is : Save your money . You will most likely be very disappointed in the end .
12688|1|A few years ago , I believed this garbage . After his later fantasies , I'm a big fan of General Motors !
12694|1|Shrewed guy this Michael Moore , makes millions selling lies . What's allarming is that many buy the " facts " in his " documentaries " .
12695|1|Michael Moore can kiss my republican ass .
12711|1|Everyone who rated this movie as great must really be truly blind . Shroomwoman is exactly correct . In the movie , Mr . Moore expresses how he cares for the victims of Columbine . About how scary the whole incident was . Mr . Moore made millions of dollars from this documentary . And how much do you think went to the poor victims of this terrible tragedy ? $ 0 . Suprised ? Shouldn't be . Especially when he balmes all wealthy and rich people in America for the poor people's problems . Yet , he was the man who made millions and didn't give a single dime of it to anyone but himself . God , I hate hypocrisy . Anyway , this film , if you can really call it that , is nothing but Moore's own opinion mixed together with political views . And lies , of course . Mr . Moore visits a weapons of mass destruction facility as it is described in the film . In reality , it was not making any weapons , but satellites . He compares US gun violence to the gun violence in Australia , as well as other countries . About how Australia only has a few hundred vioent crimes while the US has thousands . Yet , then , you ask yourself , what is the population of Australia vs . teh US ? LOL ! Its little pieces and bits if information and facts that are left out of the movie . Just like the timeline of the US , that blames America for 9-11 . That's right . Watch the movie and feel the disgrace in your stomach . I did . Mr . Moore is just a filthy liar , who is trying to brainwash you into believing his lies . Don't fall for him . Everyone who supports this film is an idiot and a tool .
12715|1|This whole fake documentary was all made up by Michael Moore . Check out this website ! bowlingfortruth . com
12717|1|More of a propoganda film that anything else . I'm a liberal , but I hate when my fellow liberals churn out false propoganda to brainwash the masses . Same for republicans and other politicians . Michael Moore may be a smart man , but he doesn't depict himself properly when all he does is piss and moan about one problem instead of adressing every aspect of it . FOR ONE THING , Michael Moore only adresses 4 countries in the world about gun violence . Look at some places in the middle east . Gun violence is worse there than America . We ought to go there and try and help those poor kids there . Michael Moore also spins some things out of control . SOme of the links he makes between gun violence and what causes it . . . . . . . Jeez . In my opinion , What causes gun violence is poverty and overcrowding which also causes mental instability among many .
12725|1|Simply put , Bowling for Columbine is a disaster of a movie . I thought it would be at least somewhat thought-provoking , and instead I found it disjointed , uninspiring , and too slanted to be taken seriously . The movie jumped around from one issue to another with such a heavy hand that it seemed like a joke ( and perhaps it was ) . Michael Moore's interactions along the way were extremely annoying , and I kept asking myself why he didn't ask more intelligent questions . He certainly had some interesting ideas to work with . To top it off , the movie seemed to go on forever . When I see how much acclaim this movie received , I'm baffled . Perhaps it's the Emperor's-New-Clothes phenomenon . . .
12730|1|False , contrived and utterly taste less . This Corpulent Fool is a liar who if he reported the facts of Columbine would disprove all of his opinions .
12741|1|If you had a soldier who was for the war and a soldier who was against it who do you think would be in this film ? This movie is nothing more then political garbage with extreme exagerations and bias . If anything he has made our nation more stupid then it already is and should be punished for such filth
12744|1|Run far far away from anything Michael moore writes . The slant he writes with is unbelievable . I find it hard to believe the First Amendment protects his type , but it does . Betcha the Framers never saw him coming . . . betcha they're wretch the minute they saw his pile'o' * * * * .
12748|1|UPDATE : Say goodbye to America , hope you enjoy your police state ? Facts are facts ? Reav , whew . Now , there are lots of things you can blame on a public high school education , but your kool-aid distribution seems a little more serious . Moore's movie is factual ? Even the faithful Deaniacs don't try to purport that . Just line up in Michael's kool-aid line when he tells you it's a fact that it's good for you . I'll remain in the police state I just voted for . And bluetar , being propaganda doesn't make it false ? Look up the definition of propaganda again . ORIGINAL COMMENT 3 / 4 / 05 : This is on the wrong list . Where is the list on crockumentaries ? This rates a 5 there .
12753|1|Just one of those movies to get everyone to vote for kerry . Plus , how could moore know anything about what bush did ? he's a director . I only saw the beginning because i got bored with it .
12754|1|I'm loving this bulshit . Its troops like the ones in Iraq and overseas that make it possible for a fat lard like Moore to make a flick like this . Just disgrace . It is unbelieveable how people can go along with liberal propaganda and believe that Bush is in Iraq for HIS PERSONAL REASONS . Get a clue and realize that we did not elect a president who is so foolish . As Fheit as a movie , poor insight with one sided views . Whomever made this movie needs to kill yourself . We love you Michael Moore . Keep putting out bad movies because the republican party loves to bash your liberal propaganda . Just remember who controls the senate . Bill Frist .
12756|1|Pure cut and paste . I thought documentaries were based on fact . A look into the mind of the hollywood left . They see the world as a big picture that is to be directed to their taste . Even sadder are the mindless zombies who believe and base their arguments on this garbage .
12767|1|Try FahrenHYPE 9 / 11
12772|1|lies , have you seen gearge bush talk about the men he sent to war , hardly a man who did it for political gain .
12779|1|This should not be listed under documentary . . . . purely fiction trying to be sold as truth to an unaware public . . lies , misrepresentation and deceitful editing techniques to get his blatantly weak points across . . .
12781|1|This is NOT a documentary at all . Its Moore's distorted facts , half truths , and lies that is all jumbled into one big disasterous propaganda piece . And its not because I just don't like him . the movie jumps all over the place , from one issue to the next . It was poorly put together , and does a poor job of linking Bush to Saudi Arabia and Saddam . He only allowed soldeirs who were against the war to speak out . He also said that only one Congressman had a family member in Iraq , which is a LIE . There are actually 4 of them . How can anyone take this crap seriously ? Every time he tries to get serious , he quickly ruins it with cheap shots and jokes at Bush . Like Bush's bad looks or his poor speech . What mature , fair documentary does that ? The notion is given that all soldiers are against war , and that only conservatives supported it . He never once mentions who several liberals , including Mr . Kerry voted for military action and for the Patriot Act on several occassions . He mainly just reinstitutes information that has already been told by everyone else . I learned nothing new from watching this . Nothing . Instead of trying to make me support Kerry , ( which is the entire point of this film ) he has only managed to make me support the President even more . The opening is the worst part of the movie . He tries saying how Al Gore really won . Really , when are the sore losers from the left stop thier bitching and moaning ? YOU LOST ! Get over it already . Back to the issue on Iraq , if Moore actually said that liberals and Kerry voted for military action , I would have given this a three rating . But he didn't , because he's biased . He is an admitted Communist . And no , he did not make any money off of me . I purchased a ticket for another movie but seen this instead . Like Ive said , no knew information on current events was unfolded in this piece . Mr . Moore was simply doing what he does best- making millions on the deaths of innocents . He's is a really awesome at propaganda pieces . Joseph Goebbels would be jumping for joy if he seen this . Moore complains that there are not enough troops in Iraq . Why doesn't he sign up ? Huh ? It would do his fat body some good . This comment may sound like a personal attack , and it some way it is . But I hate liars and hypocrites who love to distort the American public .
12782|1|Christopher Hitchens ( a lefty , former editor of The Nation , who is redeemed by being intellectual honest ) had the best review of this film : Fahrenheit 9 / 11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity , crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness . It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of 'dissenting' bravery . Read the whole review at http : / / slate . msn . com / id / 2102723 /
12785|1|I don't plan on seeing this because I don't see the point . After Moore's performance at last years Oscars I lost all respect for this idiot . This country is probably facing one of its toughest battles , I am talking about the war against terrorisim . Does every one remember 9 / 11 or was that some kind of Republician stunt , I think not . this moron is using to forward his agenda .
12790|1|What a joke ! ! ! You guys should really get your facts straight and don't trust a puppet that's funded by Hollywood . His documentary is riddled with more holes than a slab of swiss cheese . First of all he used an excerpt from a Bush speech and claimed it was regarding the Iraq war . In reality he was talking about the Israelis and the Palistinians . He claims that Bush invited the Taliban to Texas for a visit . Wrong , a Texas oil company that had nothing to do with Bush invited him . What he failed to mention was the fact that Mr . Bill Clinton actually DID invite the Taliban to visit this country ! Nice try Michael Moron . . . Please do yourself a favor and check the facts out before believing any of his propaganda .
12793|1|What a waste of a movie . . . If Americans want to eat fast food , let them eat it . This was just a stupid movie about a man who wanted to prove how bad it was for us . Anything you eat 3 times a day for 30 days isn't going to turn out pretty . What an imbecile
12795|1|Well if you overlook the fact that his assertions about McDonald's are complete supposition based on scientifically inadmissible evidence then the film is only , well , a piece of crap . Mr . Spurlock makes no compelling case against McDonald's or fast food in general . He accuses McDonald's of being interested only in the bottom line , yet when his doctor's advise him to discontinue his experiment he bravely forges on so he can finish his film and sell it to the masses . Who's interested in the bottom line now Mr . Spurlock ?
12803|1|Just as Michael Moore spread lies about America in Farenheight 9 / 11 because he actually hates America , I have no doubt Spurlock used this as anti-fast food propaganda . Putting aside the fact that a reality movie should never be made , this movie is biased in the fact that McDonald's is all he eats . I mean , he doesn't even take any nutritional supplements for goodness sakes . Even I , a fast food fan , know that you can't eat fast food every meal and that vitamins are necessary for optimal operation . Even more , this movie is so anti-fast food as to make me sick . As I believe someone said , Give me Chick-Fil-A or give me death !
12816|1|Beautiful film , if you are willing to ignore 6 million dead jews that came afterwards , off screen
12838|1|This movie is a complete sham ! I love Walmart . Their success in a very competitive market proves how great of a company they are , with excellent upper management . Keep on bringin me those low prices .
12840|1|This sucks . Didn't the same guy that made that first Biggie and Tupac movie make this ? I thought it was amateur filmmaking . This investigating director should be working for 'Celebrity Justice' or some sh * t .
12844|1|Tupac : Let It Rest
12845|1|NO ! . . . NO ! . . a thousand times NO ! Tupac is the busiest dead M * * * * * F * * * * * that I know . What ever happened to taking a 'final' rest ?
12846|1|I prefer Tupac dead .
12848|1|Can this be categorized as a documentary ? What the hell . I'm ashamed that I've even seen it . If I recall , it had far less t * tties than I expected going into it . Documentary my ass .
12850|1|Dumb .
12852|1|Would someone tell me why a REALITY movie was made ? For , I have no clue .
12853|1|Garbage .
12854|1|Most people would rather spend their money on the latest volume of Girl's Gone Wild .
12855|1|Is this a joke ? Why would I watch this crap for $ 10 when I can stay at home and see it for free on MTV or Fox . Whoever came up with this idea is an idiot .
12870|1|Just when things were looking up in the movies they made this . . . awful . . . .
 1297|1|That movie was an asault on my ears !
13040|1|to much drama
 1305|1|I never got into the whole Pulp Fiction thing like everyone else did . Personally I thought the movie sucked .
 1306|1|the most boring movie i have ever watched . i normally don't sleep while watching the middle of a movie or in this case the first 40 minutes .
13070|1|what an overrated film !
13076|1|black & white
13089|1|The only unedited R-rated movie to have the NONhonor of airing in broadcast primetime , this movie's nihilism and headache syndrome is out of control . Stupid and WAY TOO DARK !
13092|1|I see Piano gets several OSCARS . I guess if you make a film about the holocaust you are guaranteed an OSCAR . Gee , what a surprise .
13097|1|Where should i begin ? This was a terrible movie , everything about it was just plain terrible . The only reason it was as well known as it was is because it was about the Holocaust , it was cheesy and phony , i just didnt enjoy it and i beleive that it shouldnt be considered a great movie . Take from me , dont waste your time with this trash .
  131|1|I thought this movie sucked majorly !
 1312|1|Not up to the level of Hong Kong martial arts movies
 1315|1|I didn't really think it could be any worse than the first one , but it was . A horrible movie with no entertainment value whatsoever , but what do you expect from a degenerate like Quentin Tarantino ?
13156|1|The Godfather movies deserve nothing except to be destroyed and put out of their forsaken misery .
13275|1|Saving Private Ryan - FUBAR !
13281|1|This movie is so graphic that it brings a whole new meaning to the word . Sure , I can here the sillies in hollywood now , That's how it was ! That is , of course , a lame excuse to do whatever they want , including copious violence , profanity and sexuality . Here's another movie to avoid .
13283|1|The movie was good . . . but Speilberg's politics suck .
13316|1|Mr . Spealberg , please , stop doing that films . I only liked the first 20 minutes .
 1332|1|An unpleasant little film made by an ubergeek who's clearly trying hard to compensate for his planet sized nerdiness . What was the point of it exactly ?
 1335|1|As a violence director , this is even more insipid than Pulp Fiction .
13354|1|Simple , simplistic , utterly contrived , and frequently just plain dull . There is absolutely nothing to this movie . About as profound as a bad comic book .
13373|1|Forrest Gump is , without a shadow of a doubt , the worst film I have ever had the sad misfortune of viewing . This celebration of gross stupidity is crass , completely lacking in any genuine wit and moves at a sloth-like pace from ridiculously contrived plotline to another . Tom Hanks , a leviathan of modern film-making , is as sickly and lacking in charisma as ever . I would sooner watch my Grandmother being savaged by rabid Tigers than view this piece of rubbish again .
13380|1|What's the point of this moronic movie ? The acting is stilted , the jokes fall flat and the tone is typically dark and moronic . Can't compare to dramatic masterpieces such as Star Trek : Nemesis , Pokemon 4Ever , or Superman IV : The Quest for Peace
13387|1|I've seen this ridiculous movie and it doesn't move me . It's boring . What does it mean ?
13397|1|The most overrated movie of all TIME !
13405|1|Overrated . Terribley overrated . I demand they give back the oscar for best picture .
13481|1|Overdramatic , dark , boring and laced with useless profanities , this R-rated terror of the night needs to learn some lessons from other dramatic franchises such as Star Trek .
13512|1|A movie that has no respect for the middle class . The scene in which Mena Suvari could have been shot in from the side and suggested nudity , but Director Mendes has no respect for Suvari and exposes her . You can see her discomfort . Truly and ugly and hateful film .
13523|1|The movie to see of the year , at least , according to the critics who didn't pan this movie . The movie follows around a pervert of a man , his premiscious daughter and her friend that is the same way , his wife in an affair , a racist neighbor and his ditsy wife , this one has no one with any sense of morals anywhere in it ! The film is laced with graphic descriptions of sexual activity , profanity , nudity , drug use , amoral attitdues , and tons of other stuff that shouldn't be in any movie . Don't even accept this one for cash--unless you tape something over it like I Love Lucy , Andy Griffith Show or a movie like Gus or Emperor's New Groove .
13524|1|Most overrated , overhyped piece of boring crap I have ever had the misfortune to TRY and watch . The WORST .
13536|1|I hated it . All American white Trash moive !
13542|1|American Beauty is an absolutely terrible movie . Anybody who has any morals should not like this film . It is a laboriously long film that exlploits teenagers and is very vulgar and lame . It is a degrading piece of garbage that never should have been made . Why it won so many Oscars is amazing ! Maybe the academy is taking more to trash these days though .
13551|1|Early on , I realized that the title , among so many other things about this movie , was meant to be sarcastic . It's obvious from the opening scene that there is not going to be anything even remotely related to the word beauty involved . In fact , had its creators been looking for a more descriptive straightforward title they could easily have come up with The Ugly American . After the initial shot of ugly , my brain , conditioned for such occasions long ago in the 60's and 70's , starts telling me that I will now have to switch into the late 90's , hip , nihilistic , black comedy mode . Then I remember , Whoops ! I think my warranty on this mode ran out sometime during the 80's ! The result is that now , when I'm faced with this brand of tripe I find it harder and harder to forgive the movie makers for several things . Number one , I can't forgive them for insulting my intelligence crud is crud even when it wins three or more Oscars . Number two ; I can't forgive them for taking my money in exchange for this crud even if I did wait to see it at a cheap seats theater . Number three - and this is the big one - I cannot forgive them for their basic statement that because they have found yet another artistic witty , and original way to present crud and , in the process , also managed to convince a panel of lost souls that they deserved national recognition for it , that we should all grow up and thank our lucky stars that these forward thinking artists have given us something with which to be entertained , educated and dog-gone-it , perhaps shed yet another layer of that pesky morality thing that seems to keep popping up as it continues to die . In other words , if you're really with the times you will genuflect to the golden statue as you swallow this crud regardless of the fact that it stinks on ice . Pardon me while I get my gag reflexes under control . Unable to ever switch into the proper mode , it was easy for me to see the direction and ultimate destination of American Beauty . It starts out ugly , moves quickly into even uglier and ends with a violent , crashing , ugly grand finale which makes War of the Roses ( Michael Douglas , Kathleen Turner ) seem like a little , domestic squabble . Since viewers are treated to generous portions of perversion , violence , psychotic behavior , irritating teenage angst , pathetic mid-life crises , and a three-layer selection of dysfunctional families , there is a little ugliness for every age group and personal taste ( or distaste ) . Add to this the fact that not one character in the entire film has even one redeeming characteristic or the ability to elicit the slightest bit of sympathy and you have yet another great reason to NOT go to the movie theater .
13558|1|I can't believe this ordinary piece of crap got critical acclaim and that it received accolades for the writting . And don't tell me that it was so clever that the characters were thinly drawn - that just results in a whole film where every scene is unbelievably dumb - and we're supposed to be seeing humanity - no idea .
13570|1|Although there were some very poignant moments in this film , it completely glorified a sick obsession that is not only illegal in all states ( except maybe Arkansas ) but morally depraved - I'm talking about pedophyllic behavior . The language of the 16 year old girl is right out of a white trash trailer park - it totally disgusted me .
13600|1|This was a movie that tried too hard at depth . It was about some guy going through a mid-life crisis , and it's effects on others . whooptie do .
13609|1|If only there were a lower rating than 1 on RateItAll . This movie may have held your attention -- but more out of curiosity for how much worse it would get . I'm certain loving this movie must be a reflection of something very dark within you .
13617|1|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen . It tries too hard to be deep and artsy
13619|1|I never thought that a movie version of this wretched book could actually be worse . In a major cinematic achievement , its not only worse , it is spectacularly , unbelievably worse .
13636|1|And the indoctrination of America continues . . .
13645|1|This movie was quite disturbing . it was just too much and a little one sided . Racism lies in every race , not just one .
13689|1|I fell asleep !
13744|1|I'm going through all the movies currently in the Top 20 , and this is the only one I really did not care for . I was so bored , could not wait for it to be over .
13748|1|Predictable , sentimental garbage .
13752|1|It was a riveting movie , but like so many others , was ruined by giving us anti-southern stereotypes . Those clowns in Hollywood don't have a clue what it's like to live here in the south . Tom Hanks is a fine actor , and is worthy of much better than this .
13758|1|Another boring , sleepy , profanity-laced , headache drama with no light moments and no happy ending .
13827|1|Can you say SUCKED ! ! ! ! !
13836|1|Saw it once ; never want to see it again .
13933|1|I gotta agree with dark . Not a very good movie at all . It promotes the idea that it is okay to abandon your buddies and friends during a time of war . It was long and it was boring . The scenary was beautiful , but I just can't get over the fact that I invested three hours of my life and $ 7 ( US ! ) to watch this worthless flick . But , what can you expect from Kevin Costner , one of the most untalented , over-rated hacks of all time . He has made very little that is actually watchable .
13935|1|Over-rated garbage . Guilty White Liberal idea of how the Noble Savage was destoyed by the White Man . See Black Robe for a more realistic view of Indian / White interaction .
13936|1|So . . . long . . . and . . . boring . . .
13939|1|a truly unremarkably film , , , , but remarkable in its ability to trick people . brimming with unrealistic sentimental nonsense designed to tug on your little heart strings . which disguise the long boring plot and horrible acting of kevin costner . second to water world as the worst KC movie . and second only to titanic as the worst academy award movie in history .
13960|1|Maybe my copy is diffrent . Me and a friend watched it and we bored stiff . Last 25 minutes of it are pretty good . The rest of it will put you to sleep . Im a big De Niro fan . Thats why I got it but even he could not save this film
13979|1|Filled with so many profanities , it has no use at all .
13984|1|I really hated this movie . I thought it was really really boring , and it wasn't original or unusual . There is a scene where Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are eating big cheeseburgers and kssing at the same time . I saw that in the movie theatre , on a BIG screen , and all i have to say is EEEEWWWWW !
13989|1|Just another psiquiatrist movie . Predictable . The characters didn't really say anything , to me .
13991|1|It's good for insomniacs . It put me right to sleep and the plot is a wee too cliche . Good acting though . and who said these guys came out of nowhere ? Ben affleck did other really good films long before this one .
14028|1|Just shoot this horse already . I laughed . I cried . I almost lost control of my faculties . This film is the height , the epitome of chick-flickism . The trials , the tribulations : whoa is me . If you're forced to watch it , bring some arsnic .
14066|1|The fact that Ron Howard directed this may attract viewers , but it will only leave them cuonfused and bored out of their minds . Apollo 13 is the story of 3 astronauts whpo go into outer space , but their spaceship breaks down and leaves them out there , stranded without their families . I was extremly disappointed and you will be too .
14205|1|Can a movie get any worse than this boring drama ? I am sure , but not much !
14224|1|Boring , uninspired , totally uncreative headache drama filled with bad acting and bad writing .
14229|1|terrible movie ! deserves the bottom movie !
14230|1|booooo !
14233|1|Lord of the Rings deserved that Oscar . . . . . not this pile of crap .
14238|1|Josh Nash was a Nazi and an anti-Semite . You people suck .
14251|1|i thought this film was absolutely rubbish and had no reason tyo be enjoyed by the viewer . i have my opinion so dont care if u others enjoyed it becaus ei didnt
14260|1|Good acting but a terrible over politically correct plot .
14268|1|What a pile of dog crap this was and over rated . It is supposed to have some deep meaning about internal struggles , to me it is the story of a mad man told from the slightly saner personality .
14276|1|Pathetic . What is so great about this movie ?
14287|1|A movie that contains no optimism and has protagonists spreading evil , this one should certainly be avoided at all costs by everyone . The hero of the movie containmates restaurant food and makes illegal soap . These insane people then want to fight to be able to feel . That makes no sense . This , of course , leads to alot of gore and blood , with senseless violence all around . Of course , this terror of a movie got critically acclaimed . But we all know adult means sexual and gritty means filled to the brim with senseless violence . Whatever happened to the G-rated live-action genre ?
 1432|1|This made no sense whatsoever . At least the book it's based on is worse .
14331|1|This movie is so unrealistic it isn't even funny . And the acting by the cast was awful , considering their talent . I think I would much rather watch the adult porn movie version of this called Driving Miss Daisy Crazy ! LMAO ! ha ha !
 1437|1|Unpleasant , pointless trash from the most overrated film maker of our time . Tarantino is an uber-geek desperately trying to over-compensate for his extreme nerdiness . I suspect Comic book guy from The Simpsons would be a big fan .
 1438|1|
14394|1|i fell asleep .
14405|1|This movie was as about as much fun as having detention on a weekend . It just goes on and on and really who cares they are bunch of brats that deserved to be locked up . A lot of people go on about how great this movie is and I don't understand that . One of the most over rated movies of all time .
 1441|1|I really don't get it ? ? Is it because the chick is hot !
14416|1|Very disappointing - and what happened to the ending - did they run out of money ? ? ?
14479|1|stupid picture . stupid actrees .
14491|1|I'm in the minority I know , but this movie was not what I expected . It was pure cheese .
14498|1|I respect Tom Hanks as an actor . I like many of his movies . But , c'mon . . . what were you thinking Tom ? The movie was 2 1 / 2 hours long , and 2 hours of it was just YOU on the island . It could have been a better flick but , should've cut out most of the volleyball Wilson crap . HORRIBLE ! ! !
14505|1|Boring , heartless , mean-sprited and too dark and headachey to be of any entertainment value to any one . Maybe Tom Hanks should consider doing a Bosom Buddies movie or Toy Story 3 ! ! ! !
14506|1|stupid movie tom hanks should be sorry he made this movie good thing he is such a big star or it could of hurt his career
14509|1|suck
 1452|1|I hated this movie . It's incredibly unrealistic and very cheesy . I personally find its ridiculous fight sequences to be a disgrace to all martial artists and especially to the legacy of the samurai ( whose sword art was very poorly portrayed throughout the film ) .
14528|1|What the hell were they thinking when they came up with this movie idea , Its sucks , one of the most boring movie I have seen
14530|1|REALLY , REALLLY BORING MOVIE ! ! ! DON'T GO SEE IT ! ! !
14544|1|This movie was horrible . What the hell was up witht the whole whale scene . Please dont see this movie unless you bring a bag to vomit in . Trust me i wanted to projectile vomit all over the place . What this movie needed was some zombies i am out peace
14625|1|How did this movie garner so much critical acclaim ? Furthermore , how could this movie be so bad when it had so many fine actors ? The plot moved way too slowly for my taste . I found myself not caring about any of the characters , ( they weren't very likable ) which caused me not to care about what happened in the movie . One of the worst films I've ever seen .
14626|1|What an awful film ! ! ! ! Clint Eastwood tried hard to steer this movie into something that is intriguing and interesting and it was for a while but then the film fell apart and the storyline became really stupid .
14627|1|This movie just about has everything I do not like in a movie . The characters are anything but upbeat and optimistic . The world that the movie set in has no creative flair--not even a stylized chair can be seen . Dramatic movies should be good vs . evil , with the lines clearly drawn , but this one certaintly isn't . There's gory violence , gobs of coarse language , and sexual material as well . The topic of the movie is also highly disturbing and anything but friendly . Finally , the ending is anything but happy , with a blissful ignorance of justice or the law .
14628|1|A overrated pile of rubbish . Unbelievable story . Manipulative . Bad Boston accents . As for Sean Penn , see 21 Grams for a better , richer performance . As for Tim Robbins , his performance in Jacob's Ladder runs circles around this . As for Kevin Bacon . . . . ( don't ask ) .
 1464|1|So much violence and gore that the movie has no redeeming value .
14686|1|I can't believe people actually liked this god awful movie . A real lawyer wouldn't let some piece of trailer trash that dresses like she's a friggin' prostitute yell profanity in their face . But I guess if you flash some cleavage you can get whatever your tiny heart desires .
 1472|1|Congrats to Quentin Tarantino for once again proving that he cannot make a movie without pointless violence . . . . . the man is seriously sick and has no talent whatsoever . . . . . why anyone would show him any respect after the horrid Pulp Fiction is beyond me . . . .
14741|1|When are people going to realize that Julia Roberts is one of the least talented actresses ever to ( dis ) grace the screen ? This movie is an insult to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence . Chauvinism aside , theres not a company in existence that would put up with a bitch like this past her first coffee break . Grotesquely implausible , forced acting performances ( especially from Roberts ) , and vapid dialogue makes rates this movie a must avoid .
14751|1|suck
14762|1|This was written by Dr . William Pierce http : / / www . seanbryson . freeuk . com / articles / jews_white_slavery . html Steven Spielberg's pseudo-historical film about a 19th century mutiny and massacre aboard a Spanish slave ship , Amistad , and the subsequent trial of the Black mutineers is being praised by the reviewers . Spielberg , one of the wealthiest and most successful of Hollywood's Jewish film makers , is also being praised by his kinsmen in various so-called human rights organizations for using his propaganda skills to sensitize White , Gentile audiences to the horrors of slavery and make them feel just a little more guilty for treating non-Whites so badly in the past . What the film doesn't mention , of course , is that Spielberg's Jewish kinsmen owned many , though not all , of the ships involved in the 18th- and 19th-century Atlantic trade in Black slaves and , in fact , played a very prominent role in bringing Black slaves to America . The film tends to steer one away from blaming anyone for slavery except White Gentiles . This bit of misdirection is interesting in light of the fact that Jews have been dominant in the slave trade since at least Roman times -- especially the trade in White slaves . Jewish slave dealers followed Caesar's armies everywhere -- into Gaul , into Germany , and into other northern lands -- eager to buy as slaves all of the captives of the Romans -- especially the female captives .
14867|1|A phony movie from top to bottom ! True story of racism DISNEYFIED . ( I have yet to see a group of people break out in song ) A waste of time .
14874|1|Another angst-ridden drama with no bright spots and no smile-worthy moments . Stay out of THIS bedroom .

14899|1|Aside from one humorous scene involving a rocking chair and the occasional cute moment , this movie is not enjoyable in the slightest . The acting is too low-key and very angst-ridden . The plot is wholly uncreative , very cynical , and borders on nihilistic . The battle scenes are terribly done , and the gore factor kills them completely . And , the movie drags on for way too long . Even the historical aspects of this film cant redeem it in the slightest . Rene Auberjonios ( Star Trek Deep Space Nines Odo ) plays an interesting characterwho is killed . That is also not a good thing .
14970|1|scandalous treatment of history . this movie is a fraud .
15004|1|ill smack you and trust me i can
15020|1|This is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen . I was hoping Winona's character would get brutalised by one of the guards . She thoroughly deserved it - whinging on on in that horrid nasal voice of hers . I watched this movie with a doctor friend of mine who was working in a psychiatric hospital at the time . He said that the basic plot ( they wouldn't let her out , even though she was a voluntary patient ) completely lacked credence . As for Angela Jolie's character , there didn't apopear to be anything wrong with her . What was she doing in a nut house ? As for having her undergo EST , as if any hospital would do that to a completely sane person against their will , even in the 60s ! What a load of rubbish .
15049|1|What a very bad joke of a movie . . . . pathetic .
15051|1|Talk about a boring , pointless , disappointing movie ! I mistakenly thought that Girl , Interrupted was going to be a moving , inspirational story about a woman confronting serious mental illness . Instead , the main character ( played by Winona Ryder ) has no legitimate reason for committing herself to a mental institution , and viewers are subjected to watching her pathetic , self-indulgent behavior as she finds herself among the crazies . Even worse- the movie drags on and on , and I feared it would never end . I started feeling suicidal myself during the last third of the movie and only watched the rest because my husband wanted to see the ending . You have been warned !
15066|1|Oliver Stone needs to read Gerald Posner's book , Case Closed - that is , if Mr . Stone can stand to read the truth . ( He also needs to learn , as all film makers need to , that actors who aren't from Texas can't hope to imitate the Texas accent - or any other accent , for that matter ) .
15067|1|Any one who believes there was a conspiracy should read Posner's Cose Closed . Anyone with a modicum of critical thinking and common sense who looks at the raw data of the assassination would come to the logical conclusion that Oswald was the line gunman . Anti-Castro Cubans , Pro-Castro Cubans , the Military , the CIA , FBI , Dallas Police , the mob , LBJ , Secret Service . . . . . yeh they were all involved . Oh what about aliens , I guess Oliver Stone did not have enough time to include them . Remember Occumm's Razor - all things considered equal , the simplist explanation is usually correct . Oswald did it - get over it ! !
15072|1|He sucked as president , so the movie would also naturally suck .
15081|1|Dumbest movie I have ever seen !
15090|1|This movie however true it might be was way to depressing for me .
15104|1|Absolute WORST 2bux I wasted in a looong looooong time . . . . . this is one god AWFUL movie with nothing redeeming in it whatsoever . . Michael D is a wasted talent here in this poorly written downer of a film . I wonder if there was actually a director on the set of this TURKEY , there is simply no emotion captured whatsover . NO chemistry between ANY of the cast / characters . . . . very boring to a lame space music score which only amplifies the lack of a original story . . . not a single credible character to care about . . . RIDICULOUS scene where Michael D ( the Dad ) meets up with his daughters negro junkie dealer and does NOTHING about it ! ! pretty DUMB when he's the head of the top federal DEA type agency with dozens of agents at his disposal . The entire plot borders on the improbable . . . . 9 count em seconds of screen time for SALMA HAYAK ? ? wished they would have given her a couple of actual lines to say . . . the junkie teenage daugher miscast she isn't very pretty or believable . . . . whoever wrote this TERRIBLE screenplay needs to have their WGA membership taken away ! ! again the WORST MOST BORING DOWNER MOVIE I can remember ( but would LOVE to forget ) in the past 5 years easily . -----Todd Michael Wiseman -----Ohio Univ College of Cinematography Film
15107|1|Sucked
15116|1|junk . it is a tour of what goes on around brilliance , but it never actually portrays any . this leads me to believe that it's writers , are also , not brilliant . it's a smoke screen . you hear about how great the kid's book is , but you never hear or see any great writing . you see marilyn monroe's old jacket . so what ? at the end , michael douglas says , oh , and crabtree ? he's still busy being crabtree . huh ? crabtree ( downey ) got virtually no exposition . what is that statement exactly supposed to mean to us ? beats me . oh , and there's a dead dog in a car trunk at one point . now that's wacky . i hate to give such a low rating , but this movie is pushing for all that it can to be some kind of dead poets society , and it simply has none of the substance which in such movies is essential . i can't believe people get suckered by this kind of obvious hype . it's a waste of time .
15120|1|I rented it and fell asleep . Boring and silly . One of the worst movies I have ever seen .
15132|1|I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it was not interesting or appealing to my best interest . Throughout the movie I constantly was falling asleep .
15154|1|Show me the value ! ! This catchprase-originating movie isn't worthy of doing so . Bad all around .
15157|1|suck
15162|1|Tom Cruise should retire from acting , because mainly he act act for beans and that he makes a total fool of himself in them . He also makes fools of the other actors and actresses acting with him . Jerry Maguire is a perfect example of how bad Tom really is .
15193|1|GAY ! No other word for this Tobey MacGuire crapfest . Man what a chick flick !
15202|1|Stupid !
15255|1|Terribly dark , violent and nihilistic film about the second world war . Bad acting combined with no creativity make this a failure through and through .
15271|1|This movie was stupid in that it wasn't filmed very well . You fall asleep in the first half hour because there is more talking than action . The film often changes to black and white which makes the whole picture suck .
15285|1|Not exactly a true story . This is someone's version of a true story using true elements they want and disregarding other true elements .
15330|1|I must have watched a different movie or something because all I saw was an annoying woman , that looked like a guy , shoot and rob a couple of men . I can't help but wonder if Charlize got the oscar for that lesbian love scene .
15367|1|Julia Stiles SUCKS . So does Sean Patrick Thomas .
15378|1|INSANITY ! ! how does this movie even compare to a REAL film ? Any positive feeling this movie could have left me with was sucked away by Julia Stiles's nonexistant acting talent ! Blech . give me a break MTV , I can't believe I payed to see this movie , someone out there , somewhere , owes me 8 bucks !
15402|1|poo
15438|1|I had absolutely no trouble falling asleep on the airplane when they aired this extremely bland movie . . . it was a nice sleeping aid . . . boring , boring , BORING !
15441|1|She had me feeling bad for her right up to the point when she cheated on her husband . WTF was that ? Her husband LOVED her so much and cared for her , and that is her thanks -- she cheats on him with that freak ? Sorry -- that ruined the movie -- it would have been GREAT and a REAL tearjerker even for guys like me -- until that SH # T . Before all you over-analyzers get on my case about the fact she wanted to experience life and all that -- and she only made love to her husband before -- shut it ! Just because she is dying does not make it right --
15461|1|Incest and Abortion . Need I say more ? This movie left me with a sick feeling in my gut . Not at all how the previews portrayed it . Should have read some reviews before I went and saw it .
15465|1|Dull Director Working .
15484|1|Of course , there would not have been a missile crisis ( and the movie ) if JFK had not left the Cubans to die on the beach in '61 . . .
15502|1|This movie was about 2 1 / 2 hours to long . I cared more about the ship then the useless made up characters that brought very little to the plot . Most over rated picture of alllll timmmmeee .
15511|1|By the middle of the movie , I was ready to root for the iceberg . Long on dialouge and short on plot , the movie passes like molasses in Antartica . The acting is atrocious , the plot predictable ( even without the sinking ! ) . It just goes to prove that popularity does not always mean quality .
15530|1|What a sad , useless thing was created here . The acting sucked . It was porrly directed . The woman had barely any boobs . This movie totally mocked the whole concept of a boat sinking . I saw it once and had to go home and watch forty-eight hours of Back To The Future , Indiana Jones , and Rocky to clear my mind of this crap .
15531|1|this is the one of only movie I will ever give a 1 star rating and I only gave it a 1 because I couldn't give a 0 ! I hated it ! DiCaprio is one of the worst actors I've ever seen . As you can see I don't like this romantic crap , it's ok ever once in a wile but don't base the movie off of it , it doesn't work like that ! the first and only time I will ever see this movie , it made me have to pee so bad ! wouldn't ever recomend it !
15534|1|this movie was horrible . it set a new low in filmic history for academy award winners , and possibly marked the point at which film reached maximum sentimental hogwash . right down there with dancing with wolves ( fools ) . cameron has developed into a total fool , having created the rather remarkable terminator and then divorced his talented wife .
15540|1|One star because of the music . I HATED this movie ! What was the Academy high on when they made this win best picture ? Leonardo DiCaprio can't even play dead , he's such a horrible actor . And no one else did much better . Plus , it was about three hours and fourteen minutes too long . If you don't get what I'm implying , please see me . It was such a pointless movie . I have no plans to ever see it again .
15541|1|Most over-rated movie of all time .
15543|1|Really bad movie only good part was when Jack died , it was so funny , I could'nt stop laughing . Rose deserved to get smacked in the face .
15548|1|has to be THE BIGGEST disappointment this decade
15554|1|I did not like this movie simply because there was too much hype involved . It was four hours long and the graphics were not that good . The soundtrack could have been better .
15557|1|This movie had only one positive . . . the real picture shots of the original Titanic under the water . Other than this , the love story thing was a huge joke . I absolutely hated it .
15578|1|What a horrible movie ! Leo can't act . There are many holes in the plot . Too big of an age difference between Winslet and DiCapprio . There are too many modern cliches in this early 1900's film . Why didn't Leo have an accent like the others on the boat ? I liked the detail of the movie like the props , plates , clothing , etc . It was so long !
15579|1|This movie was too long and too predictable . It relied too much upon the star quality of its male lead to sell tickets . It's hard to make a movie about a historical event and make it not predicable , but we all know that in the end the ship sinks . Also , if you watched the previews , you already knew everything that happens . Very disappointing , long and boring movie . I fell asleep during it .
15596|1|Biggest all time flop of 'Titanic' proportions . Don't even bother considering it because the acting stinks , the theme song will never get out of your head and you'll spend your time better sleeping .
15604|1|This move stunk ! Rose was nothing but a slut . The acting was over done it was not historicaly accurate . To bad people dont really know there history they would see how lame this movie was . However Americans are for the most part not well educated on anything not directly involving them so this movie fooled the masses .
15627|1|You aint neva guna get cold mountain
15628|1|This movie was absolute tripe , awful ! ! You can tell the story was taken from a well written book and instead of being true to the book it was completely hollywood-ised , where half-way through we were seeing the whose who of hollywood which completely detracted from the movie . Nicole Kidman is a good actress , but this movie failed to stretch her ability or show any of her growing potential like The Hours or The Others . The accents were awful , if your getting paid $ 15 million for a movie the least you could do is show some respect to the audiences intelligence and do a convincing southern accent .
15638|1|One of the worst movies of all time . It was NOT powerful , and it certainly didn't move me . Sean Astin was so UNBELIEVABLE as Rudy . . . . .
15641|1|This piece of crap winning Best Picture over Saving Private Ryan HAS to go down as one of the biggest travesties in Academy Award history .
15644|1|Most over-rated boring movie I've ever seen .
15646|1|Shakespeare in Love is the most overrated film . It had a stale plot and bad acting . I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow deserved an Oscar for this movie .
15653|1|Capricious use of Shakespeare .
15708|1|Oh my god ! This movie sucked so bad
15744|1|suck
15770|1|This movie is simply awful . From the start , you are assualted with coarse language and the goriest violence that I've ever seen . The movie is highly pessimistic , with death and angst around every corner . Creativity is nowhere to be found , with nary an imaginative spark to be found .
15786|1|Not worth my time or money .
15795|1|THis movie sucked . I mean it had pee-wee herman . come on people .
15804|1|it sucked a fat one
15815|1|This movie was just creepy . . . . . I can't believe I sat through the whole thing .
15825|1|Just read the guidelines for writing comments and you stated you love to laugh . I'm sure you were amused at one of your Rate-Its who believes that sexuality is the only thing that binds us humans together . That statement makes me want to cry for the poor unfortunate soul who lives a life believing that . The same writer also states that the human race is nothing more than cattle . Thank God . . . said writer can do more than Moo . . . he did give Quills 5 stars , which is about what a cow WOULD give it . Another comment from another writer states that Quills was about the writter Marque who wrote about his passions and sexual urges that in that time were considered wrong . Have I missed something or is it not still considered wrong to capture under age girls for sexual exploitation . I guess masturbating into a Chalice would not be termed wrong but is there anyone out there in Cyber Space who thinks some things are morally wrong ? Another writer thinks the film represents freedom . . . . . . and I ask freedom to do what ? ? ? Does the Rate-It not believe that any freedom carries the profound weight of responsibility ? This is a pornographic film and its scary that our society today gives 5 stars to pornography all the while worshiping a Golden Calf they call , FREEDOM
15849|1|I thought this movie was a waste of time . The acting was ok , but the story line was was ridiculous . What was w / the singing ? I don't think I could have stood another minute of Tom Cruise singing . His caracter was incredibly annoying . I can't picture Tom as a womanizer .
15853|1|simply the worst movie I've seen this year . they should use this movie to torture prisoners .
15880|1|I don't think that they should of re-made this movie . It's a classic and should have stayed that way . I hate when classic movies are re-made it shows a total lack of creativity . Plus , they changed the ending so now it's not as good . I don't recomend this film , see the first one instead .
15883|1|I couldn't stand watching this one , my girlfriend and I turned it off after a half hour . I didn't find it clever at all . If I want to watch a film about crooks , I'll watch Goodfellas , Casino , Usual Suspects , Reservior Dogs , etc . This one falls flat on it's face .
15910|1|Pure crap .
15918|1|One of the few films I've walked out on early on in the film . In one of the opening scenes it shows the effects of a would-be plane crash . . . I turned to my friend and stated " It looks like a movie set , " to which he laughed in agreement . Then we see a victim from the crash laying there supposedly dead , but who doesn't even look real . . . So at that point we decided it was either leaving the theatre or falling asleep - we left .
15923|1|I actually am a man who likes well-done dramatic love stories , really LOL . But I am just like Elaine on Seinfeld , twisting in agony in my chair waiting for this yawner to end .
15933|1|A great movie if you run out of tylenol PM .
15943|1|I only hate this movie because Elaine hated it on Seinfeld .
15947|1|This movie was so stupid and boring .
15963|1|Pathetically stupid and completely unrealistic .
15968|1|[ Update : I did finally see the whole movie . To prevent people from buying or renting it . . . The Movie goes like this . . . All the Dogvillians treat outsider Nicole Kidman like crap and eventually get to to the point where all the men-folk chain her to the bed and rape her . . . except for the dude who truly loves her ( even though he is an absolutely pathetic idiot ) . The stupid Dogvillians end up calling the gangsta to get her daughter , knowing that they will probably kill her . Well , turns out , Nicole Kidman is the daughter of the Gangsta who she hates and is running away from . But she hates the Dogvillians even more . Gangstas kill everyone in Dogville and burn the town down . Nicole Kidman personally kills the idiot so-called boyfriend who did nothing to help her . The End . [ Original Post ] I went to Blockbuster last night . All the Van Helsing's were checked out so it was either Dogville or Envy . I picked poorly . If just one humanoid reads my review and avoids renting or viewing Dogville , I will feel that RateItAll serves some purpose to mankind . Dogville was truly horrid ; it was more like Dog Pile . I'll get to that in a second . The pretentious and rich Brie , Chianti , and Latte Liberals who drive huge Hummers to the Sundance Festival ( yet object to common families driving SUVs ) praise this anti-American dreck to no end . And why is it that every movie that airs at Sundance truly sucks . Am I that much out of touch with the Pseudo-Intelligentsia who down our country at every turn , yet invest heavily in Defense stocks . Dogville also did well at Cannes ; but considering the even more seditious Fahrenheit 911 won Palm D'Or , that doesn't say much . Dogville is something like Our Town , except it sucks . I'm sure the poseurs and artsy-fartsy phonies marvel at the naturalistic setting where instead of a mean barking dog , the word Dog is written on the floor and supposed to represent the purportedly mean canine . The story deals with a miserable little village called Dogville ( symbolic of America ) , where people are mean and talk real slow and stupid-like ( symbolic of Americans ) . Nicole Kidman drops into a town as a Bimbo running from Gangsters ( I think she is a symbol of the enlightened foreigner , but who cares ) . The cast is pretty good with Kidman , Lauren Bacall , Paul Bettany and others who should have known better . But despite the big-buck cast , the movie has a feel of high school thespians reading off cue cards . Boredom and Tedium bludgeons you from opening credits . My wife , no kidding , was KO'd to sleep by the movie in the first 5 minutes . It took me three days to suffer through it . I would fall in and out of repose only to be bored back into somnelescence again by the dreadfully stultifying and sonorous dialogue . At first , no one does anything interesting or exciting . The first viewing of it , after about 45 minutes , I pulled the plug on the movie to watch the Auburn-Mississippi game ( far more intellectually stimulating ) . Then the movie goes from boring to disturbing and depressing . Supposedly the Danish dude who made this flick is making an allegory to how awful and rotten we Americans are , particularly in our treatment to outsiders . I guess the Danish dude thinks we ugly Americans should be more cordial to Arab terorrists after they butcher 3 , 000 of us . God , this movie really stinks . Anybody who says they like it also thinks Friends is funny , You can't be too gay , and 911 transpired because we had it coming . Hopefully , Van Helsing will be available next week .
15989|1|I hated the book and I hated the movie . Kids going around brandishing knives and families falling apart ? Where's the fun in that ? My vision of the 50s goes more along Leave it to Beaver or Happy Days lines than this uninspired , headache-inducing dreck . No fun at all .
 1600|1|Hated this film as it was very dark and created a macabre feeling in the senses . Of course , that was its intention , but a disconcerting one nevertheless .
16002|1|Awful direction with non-sense camera movements and continuos wrong use of the time in the scenes . I save the music but not the inclusion of all of the musical parts . Everybody may think it is great . I think it is terrible .
16010|1|Maybe I was watching a different Garden State from these other posters . Did they make 2 of them ? Because the one I saw was a dull stinkorama that put my wife to sleep in 15 minutes and intermittently put me in and out of reposo . All I saw was a menadering mess of GEN-X and GEN-Y slackers , losers , dudes , and dudettes wasting their North Jersey lives doing nothing interspersed with doing drugs . Unlike Seinfeld , their doing nothing was neither funny nor interesting . It had the look and the feel of a Kevin Smith movie without the humor . I just don't have interest or patience in watching a film about dudes going nowhere in their lives . I don't like Zack Braff . I hate him in Scrubs and hate his attempt to be the next David Schwimmer . Even the vaunted soundtrack sucked in my humble opinion .
16024|1|This is probably the only movie with Jodie Foster in it that I hate . The whole thing was just boring , boring , boring ! I don't even think a child would care for it .
 1603|1|Amovie that makes you feel like jumping off a bridge . Depressing as hell .
16087|1|This movies gives chick flicks a bad reputation .
16095|1|After reading the book ( which was OK ) , and seeing a list of cast members ( Natalie Portman , Stockard Channing , Ashley Judd , Sally Field ) , I thought that this movie had some potential . Boy , was I wrong ! It was awful from the start . In fact , it was so bad in so many ways that I started fast-forwarding in the hope that I'd get to something at least watchable . I never did . The acting was crummy , and the story didn't translate very well . I noticed that this movie got a one-star rating in my local paper , and I can definitely see why . Don't rent Where the Heart Is under any circumstances !
16127|1|this movie sucks
16143|1|Expected some fun here . Found a sh ! tload of virtual emotions based on the political and other things . Brutal and pointless . See and forget . This movie can be seen for time wasting but you wouldn't want to see it after again . SHMACK !
16161|1|Nihilistic , violent , and just plain stupid .
16163|1|Jeepers . What nonsense .
16168|1|Originally I wasn't even going to rate this stinker . But I feel the mass must know what a horrible job littly boy Leo did . Horrible movie !
16178|1|The most offensive piece of garbage that I have ever seen and that's saying a lot considering that I don't get offended easily . That's all that I can say about this movie . I'm sorry but I fail to see what makes this movie brilliant or even interesting . I felt nothing for the characters and didn't really care about the epic battle between the irish and the natives .
16185|1|'Gangs of New York' is probably one of the most disappointing films I've seen in my entire life . Epic ? Lawrence of Arabia is epic . 'Gangs of New York' is just long , as far as I can tell , with a few historical sidebars thrown in here and there to flesh out an otherwise rambling and somewhat pointless story . This was a fascinating time in our history , no doubt about it . But with the facts and dates all re-arranged and the main story boiled down to a simple revenge tale . . . I'm just not sure what Scorsese is getting at . While the turf war theme certainly plays into our current and horrifying political situations , that alone doesn't make me feel anything for these characters . Daniel Day Lewis does a fantastic job , no question . And Leo isn't half bad either . But with a couple of terrible musical choices ( ending with a U2 song ? It's the 1800's , for the love of pete ! ) and no discernable visual style ( it seems Scorsese said all he needed to say about fighting in 'Raging Bull' . You'll only get warmed over Braveheart fighting here ) , this movie became my least favorite of Scorsese's otherwise brilliant career .
16188|1|My god I couldn't wait until this movie was over .
16190|1|WOW ! What a stinko ! This movie was praised as being entertaining . That tells you where Hollyood has gone . I guess anything that isn't a remake of a 1950s movie , or a sequel , is considered original and therefore good . Hollywood needs scriptwriters bad ! The person who wrote the sreenplay for Lost in Translation probably didn't even graduate from High School . This movie is simply awful .
16191|1|If you ever want to watch a movie that isn't good at all , I recommend Lost in Translation . I heard great things about this movie , so I grabbed a six-pack and sit on the couch and watched this . The six-pack was priceless compared to this crappy movie ( and it was cheap beer ) . I have apologized to my DVD player every since for making it play such garbage . p . s . - Sorry DVD player .
16192|1|To say that I dislike this movie is an understatement , I loath it . Lost in Translation was a painful movie to watch . I know that the point of this movie is to feel the character's alienation , but I didn't sympathetic towards the characters . WAAAAAA , Japan is such a strange country , my life is so boring . Lost in Translation is an overrated piece of fluff !
16199|1|This movie didn't hold my attention at all . As much as I had heard about the sweet , simple plot , and the gentle charachter development , I was looking forward to it . My husband watched the whole thing , but I zoned out after about 30 mins . Very slow , boring and artsy for the sake of being so . I would not recommend it .
16209|1|Did not care for this movie at all . A total waste of time . Do not recommend it .
16213|1|I fell asleep and I never saw the end . I asked a customer ( I work in a video store ) about it and he told me the ending . All I can say is : 1 ) Boring ! ! ! ! 2 ) What was it all about ? ! ? Do they really think people will swallow that ?
16222|1|I hated this movie . I am so happy that I rented it and didn't spend $ 6 . 25 to see it . I fell asleep the 1st time . Tried to watch it a 2nd time and could get into it . Tried a 3rd , and hated it .
16233|1|This movie was a waste of $ 8 . 25 2 hours .
16249|1|Little boy gets laid story . About as interesting as someone popping zits .
16269|1|Spike Lee , for some reason , received a lot of praise for this film . I thought it was a foul-mouthed bore of a movie , whose message got lost in all the cussing . Anyway , by the end of the movie all the characters--black AND white--were all so annoying , I didn't care what happened to any of them . Spike Lee said after the Oscars that year that he was robbed , but I think the only people who got robbed were the ones who paid to see this mess .
16277|1|The Passion of The Myth
 1628|1|One of the most overrated films ever . The truth of the matter is that it's plotless , slow moving , pointless and boring with silly and unrealistic kung-fu choreographing . Stick with Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan . Absolute cr @ p .
16289|1|Terrible movie . Focuses on Jesus' torture in attempts to guilt people into believing in him or going to church . Where was the focus on his teachings and beliefs ? A big-budget horror movie and nothing more .
16307|1|I really can't see what all the hype is about -- this movie was no different than any Sunday school class or biblical epic from years gone by ; it just had more blood and gore . There was violence for violence's sake , and all Gibson did was tell us a story we already know ; yet , it's a story that is uncontested . The subtitles were distracting and took a lot away from the performances given by the actors . The saddest part is Gibson's statement ( along with his father ) that the Holocaust was a mainly fictionalized event -- but unlike the death of Christ , we actually have documented evidence of the Holocaust . It sickens me that Gibson is making so much fortune off a film about a religious figure . Kind of ironic , is it not ?
 1632|1|This is the worst movie I have ever seen ! ! Although , I have never laughed so hard from a movie ever , I almost cramped up man . The flying looks so silly , at last I couldn't do anything else than laugh ! hooh ! by the way , if I could , I would give minus 5 stars .
16334|1|For the REAL truth of this disgusting portrayal go to www . letgodbetrue . com and read The Animated Crucifix . Total blasphemy . The Word of God tells us if any presents to us another Jesus other than the Jesus of the Bible we are to refuse it . Jesus was not a long haired sissy mommas boy . Mary had nothing to do with His work on earth and she had to be saved just like any other . She is dead and in her grave now . She has no power and no authority . This was nothing but a pathetic lie and commercial for the twisted perverted catholic demon doctrine from hell . Woe to those who add or take away from the word of God . This was pure fiction and catholic supstitions and fables . Only the totally Biblical illiterates could believe this garbage .
16338|1|The Passion directing was very poor . The only good thing about it was that the language fitted the setting . Besides that , editing and angle shots were not original . There is a big mistake at the end of the movie where Jesus' hands get nailed to the cross . It was discovered a few years ago that Jesus could not have been nailed by the hands , but rather the wrists . The nails could not support his weight . The movie focused too much on the one spectrum of Jesus' life as oppose to overall picture . Mary's portrayal could have been much more effective if she would have appeared to be more convulsive as to see her only son die . Instead , she had the occassional breakdown . It is difficult to imagine who is seeing her child tortured to lack expression and deeper emotion . Frankly , I dont believe Mel Gibson did this movie for the money , but nonetheless should stick to what he does best-acting , not directing movies .
 1634|1|I did not get this on at all you've folks jumping around like they are in the Matrix and no one seems to know why . A couple of nice fight scenes but on a whole way over rated .
16346|1|Not funny . I didn't laugh once .
16347|1|Horrific , disturbing , disgusting , revolting , sickening , and spectacularly violent . As a Christian , I don't need to be tortured to love Jesus .
16349|1|It is difficult for me to express my suffering in actually having to sit through this violent foreign language movie .
16350|1|The Passion of The Christ is like a religious version of the Texas Chain Saw massacre . Its a cute trick by Mel Gibson to use blood and gore to create a controversy and line his pockets at the same time . I am sure he is grinning ear to ear and laughing all the way to the bank .
16352|1|This was a horrible movie . I actually went and saw it at the theater , mainly because of good ratings it had received and intrigued by the storyline . I did not care about one person in this film , good or bad feelings , could not tell you any one characters name . Mark Wahlberg may be the stiffest actor in the history of cinema . It basically had no storyline , just little snippets into the lives of porn actors , not even interesting pieces at that . After it came out there was talk about Burt Reynolds winning a Best Supporting actor for his part ? LOL What did he have ? maybe 20 lines ? I am college educated and appreciate well done and unique movies , but I really am curious what professional movie reviewers see when they review a film and why they rated this so high .
16353|1|one of the sleazest movies I have seen . I kept waiting for something good to happen . I found myself being very disappointed . this movie about a guy who gets into pornography one of the crummiest movies I have seen .
16358|1|Although the film started of hopeful and with a great message , the ending completely ruined it for me . The acting , from Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey , is good , but could have been executed with more energy . There are a few great moments , but the depressing ending kills the film entirely .
16363|1|Lame , too preachy . I love Kevin Spacey , but even with all the good intent ( I saw the making of stuff on HBO ) , the movie just didn't work . Subtle is better than in your face preaching . Also the gang stereotype was unrealistic .
16369|1|Looking for a boring movie that will put you to sleep , and make you have your IQ 50 points ? ? ? Pay It Forward must me your movie .
16382|1|If you watch Cruel Intentions and then you watch Dangerous Liasons , you realize the difference that world class actors such as John Malkovich and Glenn Close can make on a film . Unfortunately , the makers of Cruel Intentions selected WB actors , who apparently didn't understand or appreciate the importance of chemistry / dialogue etc . in this movie's plot .
16389|1|Pretentious , pointless and a waste of 2 1 / 2 hours of my life . I dont care how this dross is dressed up as art-house . There are dozens of plotlines ( for want of a better word ) and characters ( ditto ) that go nowhere fr'instance the 2 men in the diner talking about a nightmare , the night visit to the weird theatre , the symbolism of the blue box . . . I hate this film with a passion . OK Naomi Watts in the buff was alright but that's about it .
16400|1|I can't say it any better than Shroowoman , read the book . I read the book , and the film is totally inaccurate . First off , it is not a gun company that was sued in the book , it was a tobacco company . In the film , only one juror is kicked off . In the book , three jurors are kicked off . After being approached about her abortion , Rikki Coleman attempts suicide in the film ; they never even approach her in the book . And Rankin Fitch NEVER meets Nicholas Easter in the book . If wou want to see a good movie about a jury , see '12 Angry Men' . Trust me , it is tons better .
16404|1|An excellent example of a perfectly-AWFUL movie . This movie has all of the elements of a movie that cause me to dislike it with a passion . First off , there is no creativity or imagination present--like too much of today's entertainment , it is a pure reality , present day movie with nothing beyond the norm . There are no clear heroes or villains , and everyone has too many flaws to be chosen as the character to support . Angst and anger is omnipresent throughout , as not a single ray of optimism can be found anywhere in this feature . The ending is perfectly dreadful as well , as everyone is either dead or miserable . This is but one of the reasons I very rarely watch R-rated movies , much less enjoy them .
16405|1|If the woman had just said , Hey ! I don't own a small business so why do I have to pay this small business tax ? then all of that ugliness could have been prevented . But of course there'd be no movie after that . No big lose there .
16416|1|This was awful . Couldn't get through 30 m's of it !
16435|1|I didn't like this . It's not exciting at all , and more like a B movie .
 1644|1|Flying ? ? ? ? What next ? ?
16447|1|Robin Williams' dramatic cry alongs get really old in Patch Adams . The movie starts out okay but soon progresses into an overly dramatic movie that will bore you to tears .
16462|1|One of the worst movies I have ever seen .
16463|1|Truly dramatic and a bit corny . The dialogue did not fit in the modern day scene and it destroyed my love for the Shakespearian work . Leo's just not an impressive actor and I don't know what it is about him . I could never understand why many women thought he was / is attractive . The only thing I like about the movie is where Romeo and Tybalt battle . I think Leguizamo is a stunning actor in this movie . His costumes are amazing .
16464|1|This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in my life . I didn't mind the IDEA of making a modern Romeo and Juliet , but this movie bombed it badily . Who had the stupid idea of using the old language with the modern movie ? Nothing from this movie can be saved except to say that it was crap .
16474|1|Romeo and Juilet was a great Shakespere story that people read and loved , but after seeing the film , I have different feeling for the story . If you try and put Leonardo Dicaprio is that kind of role , you know what kind of movie you are going to have .
16481|1|I didn't like this movie because it took away from the essence of the original . Although it gave a modern perspective , it seemed as if they were trying to mix today's behaviour with ancient language .
16518|1|Worst movie i have seen in years . a bunch of legendary actors gather together into whqat would be a great movie if it were about something completely different . Donald sutherland is one of the greatest to grace the planet but not even he could save this terrible movie .
16568|1|I do not know what led me to believe this would be a comedy but I was truly disappointed when I quickly found that it wasn t . I was further disappointed that the entire story was depressing , pointless and had an ugly edginess to it . Drew Barrymore did not convince me that she was this woman at the age of 15 , 36 or anything in between . She further failed to convince me that her character was deserving of my sympathy or respect . Half the time I wanted to slap some sense into her and the other half I simply lost interest in her self-involved mindset . She set herself up , she fell and then she proceeded to whine and blame everyone around her . I kept wanting to say if you re as smart as you think you are and if college and career are so important to you then get off your butt , get a part-time job , a student loan and go for it you know , join the rest of the real world . Were we really supposed to feel sorry for this self-interested idiot who ignores her child and proceeds to dry pot in the oven of her government subsidized shack for some quick cash ? Apparently no more than we were meant to enjoy this dreadful tale of woe .
16581|1|i hated this movie . the acting was awful and it was boring .
16601|1|This film has many conceptual problems as well as my own problems with the politics in the movie . First Joan Allen is portrayed as being a centerist democrat who was once in the Republican party . However her closing statement in her interview by the judiciary committee is filled with many not only democratic , but extreme leftist views , which could never in reality come from a democrat who had at one time been a believable member of the Republican party . This type of positioning in the film only serves to make far leftists think they are actually moderates and further divide the population . Secondly , based on the statement of her politics only serves as a mouth piece for the liberals who produced , directed , starred in , and wrote this piece of tripe . Additionally , any candidate for vice president under the conditions , which she was to be appointed , would not be confirmed . Her views are too radical . There would be no need for the reporting of any sex scandal or adulterous acts . She simply would not be confirmed . Furthermore , Jeff Bridges makes no bones about his want to have a woman ( not just a woman but that woman ) fill the position of vice president regardless of her experience or qualifications . While many may agree with this approach , I simply do not . One must test the qualifications of the individual before hiring them . In the concluding scenes of the movie , Jeff Bridges requests an immediate roll call vote of a joint session of Congress for her approval . This is followed by a standing ovation by the entire Congress and applauds as though the president were going to war , which is complete and utter BS . If a woman with the views stated earlier in the movie were being brought up for appointment in that unbelievable , entirely unrealistic venue , Republicans and centerists alike would not stand for her or the words of the president . Finally , Jeff Bridges equates her politics with leadership skills and some sort of political destiny she may have . If you vote against her , you vote against a true leader . While a president might do this in reality , Congressmen can see through such propoganda . Apparently , the makers of this film think the American people cannot . My only fear would generally be that the American people might not . However , the movie was rather poorly attended , so I believe most people can tell when someone is trying to veil political dialogue under the guise of suspense .
16626|1|This movie states that after a Jewish contestant there would be a Christian contestant who would do better 2 % of America is Jewish , therefore the odds are 50-1 in favor of the next contestant would not being Jewish , all things being equal the odds are even that the next non-Jewish contestant would do better What goof is trying to imply anti-semitism ? ? ?
16637|1|This movie was stupid .
16647|1|I hated this movie . I REALLY hated this movie . They don't really explain anything until the last lines of the movie . I figured out what the 21 grams was supposed to be about early on and still the movie didn't make any sense . It just seemed like a horrible story without any meaning behind it . Sean Penn does a good job , and if you're a young horny male you'd be interested to know that you get to see Naomi Watts naked . But those are the only possible things I could ever see anyone liking about this movie . It sucked .
16664|1|Samuel Jackson was awesome , but this was the most anti-arab movie ( along with Delta Force ) . Why pick yemen as bad guys . They haven't done anything serious ( prior to Cole ) . They never said what was the problem in Yemen ; They just assumed that there was always trouble in the mid east . Why show the arab civilians as barbarians that love to kill people ( kids and women ) . Besides the ending was so predictable . The verdict could have been guilty or somebody die . They also show The US government as hypocrites . They can kill 80 civilians because of 3 navy men . Do not rent this movie , unless you like to see racism as a good thing .
16680|1|I've always been told by my girlfriends how great this film is . After I watched it I decided that the only reason why they had come to that conclusion was because Brad Pitt was in it . A great cast , but a very slow , boring script and plot which lacked any depth of character and resulted in wooden , shallow performances from everyone .
16712|1|make a movie about tyson HE is the greatest
16714|1|This is the only movie that I have ever walked out of . The story and characters were uninteresting . The movie just seemed to drag on and on . It was that boring .
16717|1|oh jezzzuz , anyone seeing this movie is a complete idiot and deserves a kick in the ass . some people will undoubtly claim best performance ever by will smith . well , duh ! he cant act , so anything is better than the past cr p . will smith playing ali , , , , its like tom green playing albert einstein . truly undeserving of a major hero of our times .
16726|1|EWWW ! i would never ever ever waste my time on this movie again . i cant believe i wasted $ 7 . 75 on it ! i kept thinking the movie was going to get better but it didnt . it was soo boring . most of people in the theatre walked out like half way in the movie . i thought it dragged on sooo bad-no i mean reeeeaaal bad ! i still dont understand the point of the movie . but its all good .
16741|1|A group of five of us went to see this movie , and only one of us walked out liking this one . Not even the person who first suggested it liked it ! ! Matt Damon and Gwenyth Paltrow were absolutely wonderful , but it would have been even better had they had a good script to work with . The same thing happened over and over , and I think Mr . Ripley's personality confused even himself . It was mundane , boring , and the worst movie I've seen since The Crying Game !
 1675|1|What a boring turkey ! It would be hard for any film to be more pretentious and contrived than this one . My 13 year old son , a martial arts master , shunned this film , and he was right . Unless you're into Asians swinging around on cables alot skip this movie ! Dutchvu
16767|1|The movie wasn't very real to me because of a lot of factors . The percussion work is impressive but too over done . I think the film made other people think " Oh cool , they must do that in drumline ! " Nah-uh . Nick Cannon's not a very good actor .
16768|1|Nowwwwwww , DenJu , not every movie like this , needs my criticism . And my rating isn't the only 1 , or 2 , star review .
16773|1|if there were negative numbers id give it a negative number but one is as low as it gets
 1678|1|The plot was horrible and the special affects too unbelievable . The acting did not help much either , especially the males ( Chou Yung Fat or such )
16789|1|Jack Nicholson always plays a crazy person well , but this film is bad . The movie starts low , and goes lower . The darkness never lets up . While this is the point of the movie , the pledge that drives a man insane , The audience is left completely unfulfilled by the end , and I felt as though my time would have been better spent watching paint dry . Do not see this film , unless of course you already watched the paint dry .
  168|1|This is beyond wretched . Gibson running around with his face painted blue makes me think he's trying to imitate some medieval Glasgow Rangers supporter . An embarrassment to anyone with any real concept of Scottish history or pride .
16801|1|I think I'm still suffering insulin shock from this sacchrine nonsense .
16808|1|This rating is based on the movie itself , and not on it being a religious movie being rated by a devout and loudmouthed Atheist . SImply on it's artistic merit , THE PASSION simply wasn't any good . The acting seemed forced and unemotional . As for the story , I noticed several errors . Just to name a few : The flogging went on too long . I believe the Romans practiced the forty save one method of flogging ( I . E . 39 lashes ) I counted well over fifty lashes . The Romans didn't pound nails into the hand , they went through the wrist . Yes , I know it showed Jesus tied to the cross as well , but this wasn't done , as it increased the time it took the poor victim to die . Peter's three denials could have been taken as one , having all been lumped together as one incident . In reality , they were propably more spread out . And if Jesus was already dead , why did the blood and water come out with such force ? Dead , no Heartbeat , No force pushing out the blood and water . Not a very accurate film . Mel Gibson should be ashamed at himself for putting out this dreck .
16819|1|Why should we care about this low life ?
16840|1|legend of uncle tom , more like .
16843|1|A silly film with bad acting .
16845|1|This movie did two things really well , it bored me and made me upset I spent the 8 bucks on it . I agree that critics opinions aren't correct a lot of the time , they really nailed this one . It blew .
 1685|1|My husband and I both thought this movie was terrible . The visuals were the only good thing . The fight sceens were to hokey with all the flying . Why did the girl take a horse when she was trying to save Chow Yun Fat if she could just fly through the tree tops ? Just to silly for words and a waste of $ 15 . 50
16865|1|again , id rather eat crap than watch this movie a second time . wow , i cant believe how much of a waste this film was of its 3 and half hour time or whatever . i have always liked sports films but this one is too much . everything about it is ridiculous , even al pacino's performance .
16873|1|sorry but you can't sell me on cameron diaz . . . . . umm she ain't that good looking not by a long shot , and there is NO bigger turn OFF than some sour foul mouthed girl with a downer attitude who's blames the world for her own screwups
16882|1|this wasn't a good war movie . some things in this movie are not true to history . in some of the battle scenes , the japanese soldiers appear to be bad soldiers . in some scenes , most of the soldiers couldn't kill the american standing right in front of them . in reality , the japanese soldiers were the some of the best trained in the entire world . i think Cage is too old to play this part . he's almost 40 and he's playing a marine sergeant . he's too old for the part . If your haven't noticed from watching the movie , everything is off . The american grenades make an explosion the size of a artillery shell . The Japanese soldiers are shown as having no hand to hand combat skills . Terrible historical film .
16885|1|The cinematography made me really nauseous .
16890|1|This movie sucked . I only watched it because of Robert DeNiro , and his character was really boring . That movie dragged on and on and nothing happened .
16892|1|Eminem is a poseur who would be slicing meat at a deli if it weren't for Dr . Dre . A lesser-talented white artist propped up by the media to sell records and lame-ass predictable movies . Don't you know when you've been sold a bill of goods ?
16908|1|I think Ted Turner funded this so he could dress up in a Confederate uniform . Some excellent cinematography is utterly wasted in this tedious , overblown pompous sequel to the far more competent Gettysburg
16911|1|Being a Southerner , I was truly hoping that Gods and Generals would be a good movie . Believe me -- I read the numerous negative reviews , but I decided to see the movie myself because I concluded that Yankees who did not appreciate Southern History wrote the reviews . However , seeing the movie was a huge mistake ! I am not exaggerating when I say that Gods and Generals is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life . Anyone that tells you that this movie is great is in complete denial . The movie , at best , serves as a how to video for Civil War Re-enactors -- nothing more . Sitting through four boring and tedious hours of this movie was complete torture . Again , Southerners are depicted as arrogant far right wing extremist and religious zealots . With respect to Gods and Generals , do yourself a favor--STAY AT HOME !
16924|1|After many Succesful modern day Shakespeare adpatations 10 Things I hate About You ( The Taming of the Shrew ) , Romeo and Juliet ( the 1996 version ) , Hamlet ( the 2000 version ) they decided to grace our screens with this dribble . I thought that it was far too ambitious using a High School as a back-drop . Mekhi Pfieffer for me was too brutal to play Othello , Josh Hartnett made a good Iago , Julia Stiles a very moderate Desdemona , the only exception was Rain Phoenix who was excellent as Amelia . No thanks I won't be watching this again .
16929|1|Is it all Julia Stiles can do is films with interracial relationships ? ? ? Not being racist at all , but enough already , we get the point ! ! ! !
16935|1|This movie is a zero . What a waste of time and money .
16951|1|Wretched , predictable claptrap . A waste of two hours .
16956|1|Oh , you've GOT to be kidding me . Why can't we have a minimum age requirement on the web ? !
16962|1|I heard a lot of bad things about this . . and they're all completely justified - confusing , pretentious and overlong . The denouement was as much of an irritating cop-out as Bobby Ewing's dreaming the whole of one series in 'Dallas' .
16967|1|Couldn't hardly follow this movie . Made no sense whatsoever
16973|1|Pathetic , especially with that stupid Penelope Cruz in it .
16982|1|This is up there with one of the five worst movies I've ever seen . Two hours of my life I'll never get back ! For those of you who think this depicts real life , I feel very sorry for you . This negative , immoral , movie was one of the most depressing representation of humanity I have ever seen . Although , it IS a study in bad decisions humans make every day in their lives . If this is what is going on in modern-day relationships , I feel very sorry for this generation . However , in all of my experience , I see less of this kind of muck , and more people trying to behave . I used to LIKE Clive Owens , and the weird thing is , in real life , he's happily married with a couple of kids ! I certainly didn't think this movie did anything for Jude Law's or Julia Robert's careers ! If this is life , then leave me out of it . I felt like taking a shower at the end of this movie I found it so disgusting ( and , believe it or not , I'm NOT a prude ) . For those of you who know people who live this way - GET NEW FRIENDS ! Sorry , but life is too short to waste on people who have no idea that happiness resides within , not jumping from bed to bed !
16990|1|A good Sci-Fi movie . I grow tired of people constantly focusing on the sex scene & forgetting about how badly the main characters treated their children . The sex scene was very sloppy & Hallie looked drugged up in ecstasy which is something I never expected her look like . This woman harbours such tremendous hypocrisy when she states Hollywood is racist when she turns around & protrays some poor needy black woman who is willing to sleep with a racist . My God where is the bottom & I am glad her mom is white .
16991|1|how did halle berry win a freagin oscar this movie is crap thwe oscar was rigged they just wanted a uhhh . . . ya know win
16993|1|After watching this piece of crap from beginning to end . I find myself asking Why ? !
16996|1|This by far was the WORST movie I have ever seen . Someone please tell me why in the world Halle Berry won an Oscar for her role in this piece of crap movie . I not only wanted my money back after this movie was over but I wanted my time spent watching this crap returned too me . Worst movie ever made ! ! Very bad Oscar choice ! ! Did they see the same movie as me ? ? I would think NOT ! ! ! !
16997|1|Tuna and I agree that you should avoid this movie at all cost ! ! ! The dramatic moment was the execution and suicide . However the Halle / Billy Bob plot wasn't exciting . They break up . They kiss . Blah Blah . I also love the writers for killing off the kid so his mother can have more sex with the old man . ( sarcasm ) .
  170|1|Awful film with boring old Mel Gibson . Historically inaccurate . Only good thing is the actor who plays King Edward 1st .
17000|1|Brando must have been hurting for money , such bull crap . . . . . . a 1' minus . .
17003|1|What a piece of formulatic crap . This movie is just another example that Hollywood has run out of ideas . It serves no purpose other that to have talentless actors showcase their bland personalities in a badly written script , and to highlight current rap music that no one will remember in 5 years ( except Missy Elliot ) . The dancing is nothing new , and the plot is overused . This will probably make some impact at the box office , but that just goes to show the intelligence of the movie going public . I know this isn't supposed to be art , but formula movies should show SOME effort to be unique and different
 1701|1|crap !
17011|1|I left the theatre feeling crappy . Purposeless violence .
17012|1|Unlike the novel by Bret Easton Ellis , which is one of the best pieces of literature ever written by man , this movie was so horrible . I know this movie was not meant to have deep meaning to it , but it could have been close to the book , which it obviously was not . Any true Bret Easton fan could tell you this . I don't think any of his books have been made into great movies to date , except for maybe Less Than Zero . I do not recommend this waste of space to anyone . : (
17024|1|This movie is the equivalent of a soft porno . The end leaves you confused and the lesbian sex makes you queasy . Other than that , the acting was alright , but still didn't makeup for the rest .
17030|1|Based on Brett Easton's equally absurd book , this turkey belongs in the elite class of films like Ishtar , Heaven's Gate , Hudson Hawk etc . Granted , it does accurately portray the greedy , power-hungry , self-centered , Stepford Wife mentality of the 80's yuppie , wall street crowd , but everything else is pathetic . Christian Bale was too old for the lead role and his acting was beyond terrible . Willem Dafoe and the great Reese Witherspoon , were wasted in their small roles . The book failed miserably at it's attempt to get real deep and psychological so the movie tries even harder and fails even worse . The did he or didn't he angle was a great idea but neither the author nor the director had the talent to pull it off . Then , to make it even worse , the director tried to make it look 'artsy' . . . PUH-LEASE ! ! . . . I think every copy of this pitiful movie should be burned . What a waste of time and effort .
17035|1|This movie totally sucked . There was no plot what so ever and the actors didn't do their best . It was nothing that I expected at all . I expected it to be a suspense / horror film . The main character was really psycho and the murder scenes were very grusome .
17045|1|There is a real David Gale up here in Canada he wasnt pleased they named this movie like that he is the host of a cooking show called Loving Spoonfuls syndicated but luckily the film tanked he wont be associated with such a terrible character like Spacey portrayed
17051|1|About a bunch of teenage or teenage-wannabe potheads . . . bah humbug .
17055|1|Ugh . What an amazing disappointment ! There's nothing worse than going to see a movie you expected was going to be good , and it all ends up blowing in your face like a bomb . I cannot believe I saw this completely crappy and pointless movie . I'm sorry if I'm being crude here , but it was just so disappointing to see Leo make a fool out of himself . I paid 5 freaking bucks to 1 . ) have all my friends make a joke out of me for about a week ( because I was the one who made them go see it ) . 2 . ) Have NO ONE at all trust me when I would say Hey , this movie looks good let's go see it ! ( no matter what movie I was reffering to ) . And 3 . ) Have to sit for about 2 hours that seemed to be the longest of all my life , to discover I had just made a fool out of myself by actually dragging my friends along ( atleast if I wouldn't have , I would have been the only one suffering ) . The movie made me feel crappy and unwanted . Can't describe it anymore ! It deserves a 0 . 1 , but the lowest was a 1 , so I'll just have to compromise !
17057|1|Yo matt likes this move so it must suck ! ! ! ! ! !
17060|1|A lot that I just didn't need here . A little of what the movie needed here . Those rebels on the beach tore the script , or smoked a lot of the weed on the island . ( Actually , that's a certainty . )
17072|1|Hopefully they cannot find any more pieces of crap by Stanley Kubrick . As always , this one is junk like the rest of his movies . I do not recommend it to anyone , it will just leave you feeling empty and bad . . . .
17083|1|I cannot believe this movie made the Top 100 list . It should not be in the Top 1 , 000 ! It is a self-indulgent , vague , badly-acted piece of tripe that in no way deserved the preamble and hype that it got . Casting Cruise and Kidman together was perhaps it's biggest downfall . . . the two of them seem to spend most of the time trying to out-act each other , and Cruise is patently uncomfortable throughout . It's almost as though the team who put it together sat down and thought of the most likely ingredients for a big audience hey - Kubrick , Cruise , Kidman , 3 hours long , artfully vague plot - Let's do it ! ( No thank YOU ! ) Eyes Wide Shut has the dubious honour of being the ONLY movie I have ever walked out of . Oh I tried . God knows I tried . But 90 minutes was more than enough to convince me I had come across one of the most boring movies in motion picture history .
17084|1|Strange movie . I wasted my money renting it .
17086|1|There is no point in this movie .
17088|1|This movie was a lame attempt at trying to be shocking through sex and nudity . I've had kinkier parties than that , and that's no lie . This story didn't excite me , or entertain me . It was dull . People should have orgies from time to time . It's good for the ego . I would have to say that the story could have gone in so many other directions to make the tale an interesting one , and it doesn't . More movies need to be made to tease the sexual psyche of people and this one didn't make it . I like Kubrick , just not this last movie of his .
17108|1|The plot is not clear and the acting was not that great .
17111|1|What ? What was that ? porno ? Don't know what was going on . Drove me carzy . The best thing in the whole movie was seeing Nicole Kidman naked and I'm straight !
17113|1|Are you kidding me ? Did you SEE this movie ? I'm not sure where to start . And I'm not sure a movie this bad is even worth a long review . But I feel the need to do my civic duty and warn people who are thinking about renting this movie : DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE ! If you ever find yourself wanting to rent this movie , have a friend hog-tie you until you come to your senses . Really - this movie is awful . And it's not even awful in a funny way - it's awful in a boring , overly dramatic way . What was Tom Cruise thinking ? His character ( along with all the others ) is just not likeable - nor is he unlikeable in a love to hate way . It's hard to enjoy a movie when you can't empathize with any of the characters . Poor Kubrick . How can the director of Clockwork Orange deteriorate so much ? With a proper story and decent directing , the acting might have been OK . But Cruise and Kidman had nothing to work with . They put their faith in Kubrick , and he laid an egg on them .
17117|1|Nothing that I can say can make this movie seem worst then it already is . One of the stupidest movies I've ever watched .
17119|1|Ironically , this is what I said when I heard that Jennifer Lopez was in another movie .
17136|1|This movie made me hate Richard Gere even more . I could never see Winona fall in love with aperson like Richard . There was no cemistry .
17144|1|Sucked . It is difficult to get over the fact that Richard is 48 and Winona is 22 . Additionally , Ricahard dated Winona's mom . How are we supposed to swallow that !
17147|1|This movie was just plain unadulterated terrible , shame on Winona and Richard for ever agreeing to do this . I hope Winona gets real fat and that Richard goes bald . . . My wife and I suffered through this and were both discusted , I was waiting for Eddie Scissorhands to come and rescue something .
17171|1|THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING BUT DEGRADATION TO AFRICAN AMERICANS , AND A MOCKERY OF WHITE AMERICANS .
17185|1|Ponderous , portentious and pretentious . Use one of the feathers to tickle the back of your throat and you can bring up this load of garbage .
17187|1|One of the most boring , dry , and joyless movies of our time .
17194|1|I'd sooner take a fastball to the berries than see five minutes of this again .
17195|1|Its for movies like this that I wish you could vote lower than 1 . What can I say-horrible acting , dialogue , storyline . . . It just sucked . No wonder Justin left Britney . You should always get off a sinking ship .
17200|1|This award-worthy movie is a total disgrace . . . now we all know that Britney can't sing OR act . Well , what would you expect from a pop star that bases her whole career on lip-synching and her bellybutton ? Britney , stop acting but PLEASE don't go back to your day job , either .
17202|1|Up until this movie , Harrison Ford had the most spotless list of good movies that any actor would only dream of having . Some would say that this movie may have started a chain of lacklustre movies . With later titles such as What Lies Beneath and Hollywood Homicide , that may be true . The biggest problem wth this movie , and the main reason why it's so bad , is the concept of the movie . Two different people meet up with one another because the strange simultanious deaths of their lovers . That's it ! There is no real plotline to follow up on . The audience is left with no real resolution . You might as well say the movie ends 30 minutes into it . With that in mind , anyone watching will be left in a state of bordem that drains the life out of them the reminder of the time . Do yurelf a favor , and pass this one up . Pick up the Sabrina remake before this one .
17203|1|Hopeless ! This movie you would think is going to be great because of Harrison Ford , but it is a shocker that just drags on and on . I walked out of this movie , and i've never walked out of a movie in my life . It has a good idea , but it doesn't reach a climax or leave you on the edge of your seat . A hopeless , slow movie that isn't worth watching even if someone paid you . Avoid at all costs ! !
17207|1|Anyone who actually liked this movie should be dragged out and shot . This defication of a movie was almost the worst I have ever seen . To the bitches that like this , suck my child shooter . . . spooge
17209|1|The constant flashbacks were annoying and unclear . I mean , after jumping back and forth through time I find myself putting the pieces together since it seemed as though all of the scenes were just slapped together . The ending was predictable after realizing that only Katie Holmes sees the bad guy . After watching this movie from beginning to end I wished that Katie Holmes had hit ME over the head with a rock and left me for dead .
17210|1|It's too New Yorkie . That elitist New Yorkie stlye that has been around in movies since the silent days . Please stop .
17211|1|More like Afterbirth , as in this stinkeroo was about as yucky as the stuff . Though I would have given it 2 stars because I didn't sleep through it , my wife actually booed it heartily as it cut to credits . This horrid movie had no mystery , suspense or scary moments ( Theme : Married dude dies jogging and is reincarnated as a creepy little 10-year-old boy who insists he is widow's dead Dude husband . Finacee dude ( who is a real schmuck ) is not amused ) . Nicole Kidman plays the goofy widow / bride-to-be who gets mucked up in some Mary Kay Latournoesque scenes ( which really grossed out my wife ) . Since the movie is so stinky , I am happy to give the plot away : little boy is not widow's dead dude husband , but actually a mixed-up kid whose head was becocked by some head games by the Anne Heche character ( who was , best as I can tell , either dead dude's mistress or first wife or something , I don't even know ) . No one lives happily ever after , particularly the viewers . Nicole Kidman has been in 3 atrocities in a row ( Dogville , Stepford Wives , and this stinker ) . I think her judgement is impaired since leaving Tom Cruise . Birth was in need of an abortion .
17217|1|This has got to be the worst movie ever . I was so looking forward to seeing it and I could not believe that I wasted my money on it .
17219|1|Could possibly be one of the most mindless movie of 2000 .
17220|1|Boring Much ? I really wanted to like this film but I just kept getting more and more annoyed . I didn't really have any sympathy for this whiny bunch of rich folks and I didn't become engaged in the story at all . I thought Richard Gere's character was pretty vacant and for a film with so many familiar names on the marquee , this film was totally unremarkable . I think that Altman is an acquired taste anyway but I can usually get into the flow of his films . This one left me hanging , waiting for a punchline , a tragedy , something to liven up this lifeless excuse for a movie .
17221|1|I SO wish there was a rating below one star . My kind husband brought this movie home to me after I mentioned I would like to see it . I was looking forward to snuggling in early and watching some of my favorite actors and actresses . I was also looking forward to laughing a great deal . Suffice it to say the movie was a complete joke , one that was not funny in the least , however . I have no idea who talked these skilled actors into participating in this movie , but they should have given their salaries back to pay the production company to burn the film . It's not worth renting , trust me .
17223|1|I rate this film terrible with the same confidence that I gave the murderous dictator Joseph Stalin a one-star ranking in another RIA category . With a star-studded cast like this ( Helen Hunt , Richard Gere , Kate Hudson , Farrah Faucet , Laura Dern , etc . . . ) you'd think there would be something redeeming about the plot , characters , anything ! There is nothinig good to say about this film . I issue a challenge to find something good about this film , the very worst film I've seen except perhaps for Caddyshack II , The Last Unicorn , and Dark Crystal . Actually , Dark Crystal may have been better than this .
17224|1|One word - BRUTAL !
17229|1|I thought it was a parody myself .
17230|1|This was a drama ?
17231|1|Lame title , lame movie . I can't believe some people actually liked this piece of garbage !
17232|1|You are joking right ? What kind of people watch this nonsense ? How do movies like this get the $ 20 , 000 that it cost to make ?
17234|1|Stupid ! !
17236|1|worst . movie . ever .
17238|1|They're running this hideous thing on television now . SO , I thought I'd see what all the negative hype was about and I watched part of it . I can't believe it ; these two dinks actually managed to come up with a new film genre - comic porn . Both sad and funny .
17239|1|If totalitarianism is like a boot stamping on a human face forever , then this movie is surely like a boot stamping on a human face for two hours .
17240|1|A 1 . 5 . I will give it an extra half point because Gigli at least did not hurt the mentally disabled person he kidnapped . othewise this is flat out boring movie . the dialogue is awful . the plot is stupid . Even though I do not think that Jennifer Lopez is a great actress , i have seen her act better in other movies . she was not convincing as a tough hit woman . Even Ben Affleck came on a talk show and said it was not a very good movie . Glad I only spent 99cents to try out this one .
17241|1|I didn't see it but I know it sucks .
17242|1|this puerter rican cant act for sh * t
17244|1|Ahh Gigli . . . I like saying Gigli . Suck mine to the people that like this . Anyone would rather slip on some ice and split their head open . It would be less painfull and humane . Douche bags
17247|1|Truly deserves a zero . Terrible . The worst .
17248|1|My girlfriend had advance tickets thanks to a contest . I begged her not to take me . I pleaded with her not to go . We went . Ben is a killer for hire ( ? ) who wants to seduce the lesbian-killer j-Lo ( ! ? ) in one of the worst films I have ever seen . The dialouge is god-awful . . . when Ben gets ready to perform oral sex on j-lo she says IT'S TURKEY TIME , GOBBLE , GOBBLE ! I can't make this stuff up . I laughed because I had to numb the pain of sitting through this horrible movie . It's worse than WATERWORLD , ISHTAR , and even THE WEDDING PLANNER . . . I think I'll pop in TAXI DRIVER right now to remember what a decent film looks like . . . I need smelling salts right now . Anyway , Gigli is BAD !
17287|1|Terribly over-rated and terribly over-acted !
17293|1|Worst movie I've ever seen . . . . . . the kid would have figured out that something was up . . . . . It was not worth the time
 1735|1|Excrement on a stick . No , retract that . Not quite that good .
17354|1|terrible
 1738|1|Boring , depressing and very confusing .
  174|1|boring
 1744|1|A very depressing , dark and dangerous movie , the movie features not only a downer of a theme , but boatloads of profanity , violence and sexual innuendo . For a good mystery , watch Murder She Wrote or Columbo , not this klaptrap .
17487|1|A stupid movie by Fellini , must have a thing about large breasts ? ? ? ? . . . .
17490|1|hi im a friend of kemaya lal kedwai who played the lil girl i dont remem ber her name in the movie i think the movie was terrible . it was a complete in sult to bollywood movies a typical flop .
 1751|1|This movie absolutly stunk . Made no sense at all .
 1757|1|Boring !
 1759|1|i walked out after thirty minutes
  176|1|Awful movie with a screwed up history , lots & lots of errors , Mel Gibson ( William Wallace ) would have been 350 years old with this hollywood boloney . . . .
17600|1|a horrible movie . I can't believe I sat through the whole thing . It was painful .
17607|1|Kudos to you andyrue . I agree 100 % with your comment .
17611|1|Like the book it was based on , Left Behind : The Movie just shows how arrogant some Christians can be about their faith . For thousands of years , people have been saying that the world is going to end soon , but the world is still here . The same is true today . The world is not going to come to an end any time soon , despite what this pretentious film tries to convince its audience . Anyone who says this movie contains the truth is a liar . They could not possibly know that this movie is true , and it is dishonest to claim otherwise .
17613|1|This was a boring movie . The acting was bad , the plot was bad , and the storyline was difficult to follow . The idea was good but it was not executed well . Do not waste your money to rent this thing .
17642|1|Typical French film . Slow moving , muted dialogue , incomprehsible plot . . it's all here . The only one of the trology worth bothering with is Blue and only because of the lovely Juliette Binoche .
17661|1|The american version seems oscar-worthy in comparison to the original .
17676|1|Awful . A script so full of cliches it could have been written by a grade seven student . It might have been better if it had been .
17699|1|Most overrated movie of all time . It's not just that it's not scary , but it's not a good movie .
  177|1|Inaccurate twaddle .
17715|1|This is soooooo stupid !
17763|1|This has to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen ! I wasn't scared once , I didn't care about any of the characters and the killer was laughable . I was just sitting there thinking : Is this it ? Is this considered to be one of the greatest ever ? When nothing NOTHING interesting ever happened . Nope I'd rather watch The Dentist 2 again .
17793|1|Stupid
17801|1|Verry dum .
17803|1|Stupid
17829|1|this sucked
17833|1|when I think of this movie , one word comes to mind : yicky !
 1786|1|the ONLY good thing about this movie is it's 2 stars performances . This movie sucked ! !
17869|1|Most overrated horror movie of all time . This movie wouldnt scare my poodle . Bad make up acting and everything else . Bride of Chucky was scarier than this joke of a movie . If i was in the room with that possessed girl i would have pooped on her face and laughed .
17870|1|I will NEVER see his ABOMINATION of a film as long as I live ! ! ! It is the MOST satanic horror film EVER ! ! ! My 10th grade math teacher was a HUGE horror fan , but she HATED this one 'cause it was 100 % BLASPHEMY ! ! ! She says she couldn't believe they got a child to play this role ! ! ! And my mom thinks that's tragic as well ! ! ! Also , I cannot BELIEVE she would tell God ; my FATHER f--- you ! ! ! She outta be SHOT for saying that ! ! ! I have heard a LOT of bad things about this GODAWFUL film ! ! ! True christians such as myself need to stay FAR away from this film ! ! ! Because of the subject matter ! ! ! People need to see " The Passion Of The Christ " instead ! ! !
17878|1|stupid
17880|1|not scary
17885|1|Not at all scary . I am sorry , but a 12 year old kid is just not scary to me . This movie is way overrated .
17886|1|this film is just disturbimg you need scary exciting entertaining and have a good time to make a horror film this is just disturbing .
17894|1|I never watched this and I don't think I missed a thing .
17895|1|Mainly stupid
17896|1|Don't watch this movie !
17904|1|I did not find it scary . I thought it was funny , but must admit that Linda Blair was totally convincing as Hillary Clinton .
17906|1|Yawn . . . i saw this movie when i was eight and it totally bored me to death . . . i almost fell asleep ! However my 2 something year old stepbrother is still terrified that he's gonna get possesed .
17921|1|I know this movie was made when I born and I would probably would have been scared and all but I saw it a couple of years ago and I laughed I don't see nothing scary about it .
17935|1|This movie is a shocker , and totally one hundered pecent not scary . I am 9 year old boy and this is poo . If anything , hilarious especially the girl going down the stairs . The Omen is far better !
17944|1|Could be the most overrated movie of all time . That whold climactic scene is retarted . That's a fact .
17946|1|One of the most overrated movies ever !
17963|1|This movie wasn't even scary !
18007|1|lOVE sTEPHEN kING , HATE THIS BOOK AND MOVIE !
18010|1|This is one those movies i only whant to see once . i didnt enjoy this movie because it was a very dark movie and it was weird .
18015|1|I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS SO SCARRY THIS MOVIE ? ? SHE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY DESERVED IN A MORE GIFTED & CLEVER WAY ! ! !
18016|1|Have rented a DVD and watched it a while ago . The movies is way too outdated , those scenes look rather gross than scary . And Carri was clueless about periods at her age , when she was already graduating from high school . OH DEAR .
18026|1|what is soo great about this movie i dont see anything
18057|1|Hated the book . Hate the movie . King should have quit YEARS before this mindless drivel . Bates did OK with what she had to work with . Gore does not equal horror . Horror is an emotion . Gore is blood and guts spewing on the screen . That doesn't scare me .
18074|1|Misery was a horror movie ? I thought is was cheesy drama .
18141|1|Pa-thet-ic
18143|1|OMG , how can this movie possibly be tied in rating with the best scary movie ever The Exorcist ? I swear to god this is the worst horror flick I have ever watched in my life . The whole movie I was expecting something to freak me out . . . but IT NEVER CAME ! ! ! HORRIBLE ! ! !
18145|1|Just stupid .
18146|1|Stupid
18148|1|The worst movie ever . It is directed by some loser Pollak director , Roman Polaksky or something . No Clive Barker , and no sign of those brilliant actors , Freddy Kruger III , Sir Jason Voorhes or J . Honeyman-Pinhead from Hellraiser . I cried when the movie ended and no one was disemboweled or tortured to death . Is this what I clean toilets all day for ? To be ripped off by fancy-pants foreign Polak directors ? ? ? Where is my valium ? ! ? ! ?
18165|1|This movie should not be classified as a scary movie . It should be classified as a trippy or strange movie . The ending is pretty inconclusive and its not scary at all .
18180|1|This movie is just not scary .
18186|1|BAD BAD BAD THIS SUCKED NOT A CLASSIC A PIECE OF CRAP
18194|1|How can this rate higher than the 1974 original ? Have fans of this remake even SEEN the 1974 version ? That version is a drive-in classic , a real product of its time----graphic without being in-your-face , gritty , darkly funny , beautifully shot and edited . The viewer actually feels " dirty " after watching it . The remake is none of the above--just exploitation . Heck , I'll take the Renee Zellweger " remake " from 1994 over this thing .
18198|1|One line for you . . . . . . NEVER SCREW WITH CLASSICS ! !
18209|1|Awful remake . . . don't waste your time on this crap .
18222|1|Awful , like the first !
18224|1|Hated it !
18249|1|That was a terrible movie ! ! ! I can not believe that you thought that , that was scary ! ! ! That is astupid movie ! ! !
18306|1|WOW this sucked . Horrible acting by no name actors and Wes Craven must have been asleep behind the camera to create such a stupid movie . Ready here is an easy formula for anyone interesed in making horror films- GORE DOES NOT EQUAL SCARY ! ! ! Go out and watch the Shining instead
18321|1|Let's see , a bunch of people you are never given any reason to care about are knocked off one by one in a variety of grisley ways . Whoopee . Pretty much sums up the modern slasher film in general . If you're that into blood and gore , why not just sit on an overpass and pray for car wrecks .
18350|1|ooooohhhhh nnnooooo . You just did not put this piece of trash before the Omen . . or even the freaking Lost Boys , for that matter . Johnny Depp's acting was horrendous and campy ( even when one considers that he pretty much did everything with his part that he could . ) and it seemed almost as painful for him to say those bland , terrible lines as it was for me to listen to them . The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a horse beaten to death . . why can't we just let it rest in peace ? What really rubs me the wrong way , though , is that Tim Burton directed this film . You don't make a masterpiece like the Nightmare Before Christmas and then do . . whatever the hell this was . If you want to fully experience said tale then read the book by Washington Irving . Please don't see this movie Oh , and Christopher , honey . . . why ? no , really , why would you do that to yourself ? . . .
18390|1|not good at all
18416|1|Let's see now , we'll take some Anne Rice dreck , add some hearthrobs , Cruise , Pitt , Banderas , and Slater , mix it altogether and see what we get . TRASH ! Avoid !
18455|1|I think it'll take a 5 star as a comdey movie . . but i would give it 3 for the stupid silly story ! . .
18461|1|About as scary as seeing dog droppings from another dog in your yard .
18462|1|This movie almost single handedly ruined the slasher genre . It sucks
18464|1|not good , Now watch Texas Chainsaw Masacure , now that was a pretty good movie !
18466|1|Sorry , I like to be scared by horror films
18467|1|Oh , the awful trend this crap started .
18475|1|This was the worst movie series ever . It wasn't scarry in the least . It was just plain stupid .
18482|1|I have had more fun FLY FISHING ! the only good part of this movie was Randy but of course as in all crappy movies the best guy dies in the sequel ( Which was a great thing for Randy ) . I may have liked it back in the day but that was before I started to understand what made a great movie . If you find this movie good try shakeing a pen in front of the computer screen you might have more fun . I think you stabbed to deep man . .
18487|1|The Shape just absolutely cannot stand this flick , and he really doesn't have a nice long explanation as to why either . He just thinks it's the suckiest sucky movie that ever sucked .
18499|1|Scream was a really stupid movie . It got more boring as the movie proceeded .
18503|1|This movie sucked . It wasn't scary at all . They should've kept it to one movie to save tape . Once again this movie sucked . The plot was so boring . I actually fell asleep during it .
18556|1|I'm sorry , I didn't find this film at all scary . A kid getting sucked into the TV ? Oh come on !
18562|1|Extremely dissapointing movie . I had heard lots of hype about this film and decided to rent it . Boy was i dissapointed . There is little horror in it , and even less suspense . If you are looking for a scare forget this piece of fluff .
18574|1|what do people see in this EMPTY movie besides a great strobe light show ?
18575|1|this movie has no heart soul , it relys entirely on special effects which , unfortunately , started a trend in Hollywood Horror movies . Jobeth Williams was very good though .
18589|1|One of the WORST movies I have EVER seen in my LIFE ! o stars !
18597|1|One of the worst movies I ever seen . I'm surprized it stuck to the tape !
18621|1|This movie sucked ! ! ! Am i the only one who was actually watching ? ? ? ? ? I was falling asleep ! ! When the movie was over i jumped up yelling Hallelujah
18625|1|Sucks !
18678|1|I saw this one when a long time ago so I don't recall much about it except a girl running away from a maniac and screaming to death the whole time and my mom loves that part eh ma ha ha : )
18690|1|Too base even to be campy , this waste of celluloid has absolutely nothing to recommend it . I'd be willing to bet this is the top cult horror pick of the Dukes of Hazzard crowd down at Ye-Ha University though .
18695|1|Don't ever watch this movie . It has a terrible plot , terrible effects and even worse acting . The whole series drags on even worse . I regret wasting my time and money renting and watching it .
18699|1|This movie gave me vivid nightmares for a week . It had no plot , just gore and blood and psychopaths . I saw the movie almost two years ago and I still get goosebumps when I think about it .
18704|1|Even the presence of Hopkins can't salvage this naff film . The attempt at the accents are laughable . Quite simply a farce .
18711|1|Over-rated .
18715|1|Sorry folks , but this movie sucked . Hey , I love Francis Ford Coppola and Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder as much as anyone out there , but this was just bad . The costumes were terrible ( excepting , of course , that see-through nightgown of Ms . Ryders ) , the acting was not very good and it BOMBED in the theaters . This has no business making this list so high , as it was a forgettable piece of junk .
18716|1|This movie was bad to the point of being offensive . And what is the idea of making Dracula's head look like a big powdered butt ? I feel like I wasted my time . The only redeeming value is that I can advise people not to watch it .
18729|1|way too silly not scary just a rip off of halloween and if you took halloween took away the direction atmoshere acting music intence feelin brilliant mood add some blood and gore leave in the style and there you go you got friday 13'th
18732|1|A slasher flick for sadists .
18734|1|I have seen some of this movie but it is just a rip-off of Halloween they tried to take the juicy eerie scary feeling of Halloween and add in a horrible story women nudity and blood and gore . So in other words do not waste youre time on this movie you are way way way way way way way way way more better of watching the extremley classic John Carpentetrs extremley scary movieHalloween .
 1874|1|Awful , awful , awful . Nick Cage's worst movie and this is the guy who made Con Air . Magnetic boots that hold prisoners in place ? What am I six years old ?
18750|1|Just a rip off of Halloween and who knows what else . Boring tripe .
18757|1|the absolute pits in horror movies . Not one good comment about this no-brainer !
 1876|1|All my fans know that im from MN I love hockey . This movie $ ucks , I woulda rather watched the ncaa finals ! Go WILD . If your not a goalie the only thing left to be is a fruit >
18763|1|I would rank this as the most boring movie I have ever seen . Scary ? ? ? for a 7 y / o possibly .
18773|1|I have a question about this movie : The whole thing is that if you make a copy of the tape , you wont die . ( it was discovered at the end ) . Rachel made a copy of the tape at the begining of the movie , but why through out the entire movie Rachel is having all these symptoms and signs as if she was going to die ? ( Bloody noses , blurry picture , hair coming out of her throat etc . ) It's hard for me to watch this movie thinking that .
18775|1|You mean all you have to do is make a copy of the tape and you're safe ? What if you gave someone a copy ? Would they still have to make a copy of the copy ? What if you copied it onto dvd ? What if you copied over one of youre Dukes of hazzard episodes ? Would Rosco P . Coltraine step out of you're tv . That would be sweet .
18806|1|I hated the f * * * ing thing ! It was so darn scary ! It got me so jumpy that it wasn't even funny ! The ending was the worst I have seen in years . What is it with modern horror movies and bad endings ? First jeepers creepers and now this ! Why did they have to kill the guy ? He was the only cool guy in the movie . That's totally not how I would end a movie . And I just wanna say that the part of the reason why the movie scared me so f * * * ing much is that it was so nasty ! I mean the dead bodies didn't have to be so ugly . . . And BIGBABY is right , too many unanswered questions . I think the horrors should be scary while you watch them and the ending is supposed to rid the viewer of all fear , because everything is supposed to be explained . My butt ! And considering that the movie was actually a rip-off of that other japanese movie , its identical copy one might say , the director has done a poor job . Message to the directors : please , don't make so f * * * ing scary senseless movies !
18807|1|Bad movie . It was allright until the ending . Coming out of the TV at the end and killing the guy completely ruined the movie . Who made the videotape ? What was the thing on horses about ? Too many unanswered questions to be good . It wasen't a tad bit scary .
18819|1|As someone else said - great plot , potential - boring as an eternity in hell and acting that makes you want to claw your eyes out . Not British films best - however , Shaun of the dead is great . Would recommend not seeing 28 Days Later - it embarasses us Brits even more . Oh , and British soldiers are not like that .
18828|1|I am sorry but I have to disagree with every single one of these comments . Maybe if the ads for this movie were different the rating would be a 3 . Everyone was saying this was the scariest movie since The Excorsist . Yeah , right . This is a zombie movie that was not scary at all . It seemed like every scene was pitch black . Its very difficult to find out what was happening . I love zombie movies , but this one showed how many zombies ? 5 ? The zombies looked like normal people just with a little blood on thier face . The movie starts off horrid ; animal rights activists cause the disease to spread . After that its good until the action starts , which is where it gets all dark . Finally , too many questions were unanswered . I hate that . This was a good idea at a modern day Night of the Living Dead , but turns out to be a non-scary , pitch black mess of a movie . Night of the Living Dead lives on !
18904|1|This movie was gory and offensive to religion . I have no idea how it got to be in the top 20 , but it sure doesn't deserve it .
18906|1|You're kidding right
18910|1|This was NOT a horror movie . I got so bored I couldn't finish watching it . Blah .
18912|1|WHY THE HELL IS THIS IN THE TOP 20
18915|1|a pathetic attempt to exploit religion and make a movie . poo .
18917|1|You people are so thirsty for a good horror film you seem to settle for cheap hour and a half long X-File knock off garbage . I saw this film the night it was realesed with high hopes of a great Exorcist like film . I wanted to be jolted I wanted to be frightened and I wanted the film to give me something to think about . Instead I got another high budget attempt at money making . This film is prpackaged cotton candy crap ! I think my I . Q . dropped 10 points just from witnessing such an attrocity . I was ashamed . I am all for religion in cinema . I myself am not a religious man at all even though I was raised in a christian house hold . I can see how some people got a message from Stigmata and I can see how it opens some peoples eyes to a new world but those people must realize this new world they are seeing is based in a lame fictitious horror movie world that is based in no solid evidence and is made to make the schmuks who believe the tabloids paranoid . Sad stuff , man . . .
18924|1|This movie sucks . The only thing that scared me were the doves . I didn't like it . It was messing with my religion .
18942|1|This movie sucked ! I thought that the plot was a little far-fetched and Patricia Arquette wasn't that great . The romance between her and the priest was unbelievable . The trailers made me think it was about something else .
18946|1|This is the sorriest movie I've ever seen . Too predictable and redundant . Bad acting and not even scary !
18980|1|Godawful sequel .
18985|1|Definitely a film you either love or hate . It did not appeal to me . The storyline is unfocused . The main character is full of himself and not relatable . The special effects are laughable .
 1900|1|John Woo proved that he can make horrible films with this one . Completely unplausible , the story is garbage . Not to mention the sappy crap thrown in with Nick Cage's love interest . Plus the chase scene was ridiculously stupid . Don't waste your time on this film .
19019|1|This was a stupid movie .
19025|1|CRAP CRAP CRAP ! the only reason it got one star was cuz johnny was in it . . and hes awesome . . .
19039|1|Boring , Boring , Boring ! If i could have had the chance to give it a 0 I would have .
19072|1|This movie really sucked . I don't think it even tried to scare anyone . It's just an excuse to show some ridiculously unbelievable and over-elaborate deaths . The end is what bugged me the most . What a bunch of losers these 'filmmakers' are .
19105|1|Pure exploitation . The actors who appeared in this should be ashamed of themselves .
19111|1|I had very high expectations for this film based on not only the hype , but everyone I knew saying it was this great horror film . To me , that's an insult to the genre . The only thing I give it credit for was it's advertising . It was a low budget film that did very well . It was a suspense film only to the extent that it kept you waiting for the suspense . . . but it never comes ! The acting hurt this movie severely , horror movies just don't work with terrible acting . And as for that plot twist at the end , well , let me just say that for anyone who's seen Silence of the Lambs , I wasn't shocked in the least . Stop reading here if you really want to see this movie without knowing the ending . Let's think about it . What exactly would the purpose be of having a dead guy laying in the middle of the floor throughout the entire movie . Why is he there ? There's not point unless . . . * gasp * . . . he's not really dead ! Tricky tricky . And not that I like excess gore , but to credit yourself as being this terribly twisted movie , a few almost shots of a guy sawing his leg off and the aftermath of that jawbreaker thing that didn't do much . . . come on . I give this movie a big LAME for being so disappointing .
19129|1|Way too gory for a comic book hero type movie ! In general , the movie sucks .
19143|1|This movie was pointless . The plot was typical . The movie didn't make any sense . It tried too hard . The movie took typical parts from other movies and tried to put it together as one .
19152|1|How did this get under the title Horror Movies ? Blade was the biggest joke I've seen in a long time . I feel sorry for Wesley Snipes , that's going to take a long time to live down .
19157|1|This movie sucked ! It had the worst music , and the storyline was horrible .
19160|1|The beginning of the end for Romero's classic zombie flicks . All these Return Of . . . movies did was make a joke out of what was a truly creepy horror series . What a waste !
19165|1|sucks big time nowhere near as good as the original overated
19196|1|I liked this movie better when it was released under its original title Mogwai Droppings
19216|1|Wow , what an awful movie . I mean really , really miserable . As shallow as this sounds , I rented From Dusk Till Dawn because the ads featured Salma Hayek dancing around scantily clad , and it turns out that was the only part of this movie worth watching . The plot is idiotic , the acting is worse than what you'd expect from bad TV , it's not at all scary , and the attempts at humor fall completely flat . If this movie was any worse , I could almost recommend it as something to laugh at , but it's not even bad enough to be good .
19217|1|This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched . For some reason , I watched it until the bitter end . I guess I was hoping , praying , begging for a twist . I was thinking , there is no way that this movie can really be this AWFUL . The acting was a joke , the plot bordered on hilarious ( not a compliment for a so-called horror movie ) and the writing was a bomb from the very beginning . If you want to see a bunch of actors in their worst roles ever with really awful effects . . go and waste a couple hours of your life and rent From Dusk Till Dawn !
19221|1|Again . . . . . DON'T SCREW WITH THE CLASSICS ! ! ! Why try to immitate ? Be an inovator , not an immitator . Romero can't even do Romero like he used to . The original Night , Dawn , and Day of the dead movies were creative , fresh , and scary . The new crap just wants to flood the screen with gore .
19230|1|Has to be one of the worst horror films ever made .
19231|1|silly not scary
19234|1|I did not like this movie at all .
19275|1|Get this movie off the scary movie list please . Its a mystery , not a horror flick . Plus the movie really blows . I wouldnt watch this movie again if someone gave me $ 40 bucks .
19304|1|Just stupid .
19361|1|not scary .
19366|1|The sequels to this movie were even dumber than the originals . These people can't act in a horror movie .
19369|1|This movie proved the theory that scary movie sequels suck . It's almost as if they thought of the story as they filmed the movie . It had little intelligence and couldn't live up to the first one .
19373|1|No matter how many Scream movies will be made , they will all be horrible . Every 'unexpected' spook and fright can be seen a mile away . When someone is walking through the dark and the camera is on close-up , of course the chick will turn around to find someone there . Don't go to get scared . You should take your girl , so she can hold on to you .
 1938|1|Oh my ! People r gonna be sorry i rated this one . Who could actully find this movie entertaining . Theres ass raping on here . thats sick . TO MY FAN : iM SORRY I COULDNT MAKE YOU LAUGH WITH THIS ONE , THIS MOVIES DISGUSTING . LOVE YOU ALL KILLABUDS4EVERY1
19392|1|I had very high expectations of this film given the calber of actors . What a let down . A real snore !
 1940|1|Not near as disgusting as alot of people told me prior to watching it . They made it sound like a movie that had to be seen , it was just that gross . I thought it was one of the worst B-rated movies of that year . . . and I still wished I wouldn't have watched it . Pure cinema torture . . . not ONE actor did a good job . . . should have been shelved . . . HORRID !
19432|1|I only have one thing to say , poopy !
19437|1|Puke ! THis film is totally boring and overrated .
19442|1|i hated this movie . the ending sucked and to me it didnt make a whole lot of sense but thats my opinion . my kids liked it .
19443|1|What was the point of that movie anyway ? I wasn't even scared , just very confused . . .
19446|1|at first it was creepy and kinda scary . Then it made a turn for the worse all of a sudden , and didn't get much better from that point on . The ending was just horrible . One of the worst endings I have seen in horror movies in a long time . I am kinda scared to watch the sequel , hope it doesn't suck as bad as this one . Bleah .
19448|1|Jeepers Creepers why did you kill my peepers ? This was a horrible movie that made no sense . The premise could have made for a good movie but didn't execute . A sequal is due later this year . Save your money !
19449|1|This is like a childrens storybook made into a horror movie . HAHA . how utterly pathetic !
19451|1|i got this movie on a free rental i nearly fell asleep over this it was plain stupid not scary dont rent it
19452|1|I spent most of the time trying to figure out what that piece of crap was and then I got bored and walked out .
19456|1|OMG Horrible ! ! Horrible ! ! I thought it was incredibly stupid and my friends and I must of rolled our eyes and laughed through the whole thing . Well at least I did .
19457|1|Terribly rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
19459|1|HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA ! ! ! . . . . ha . . . it was funny .
19461|1|If you're looking for a scary movie , stay away from this one . I had saw one critic rate it as The scariest movie I've seen in years , which is why I went and seen it over a couple of others I had in mind . However instead of getting scares from the movie , I got disappointment . Unless of course , your opinion of scary is movies like Scream .
19462|1|Really stupid .
19472|1|Cute with alot of black comedy . Jason looked horrible and the movie wasn't too good at mixing fun and violence . I felt sorry for the re headed counsler who got splattered all over her cabin . See with friends .
19498|1|afauwl terrible acting poorly scripted wierd mood messy dericting rip off of friday the 13th strang corny feel boring weird strange ending this has got to be one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen
19502|1|So darn corny ! Let's take off our clothes so we can here better ! my husband commented to the kids searching the woods . I can't believe I wasted almost two hours of my life on this !
19504|1|This movie has horrible acting and has to be one of the worst horror movies ever made . I never completely watched it because in the first 30 minutes or so it was filled with some perverted scene with a cook and a little girl at camp .
19508|1|This wasn't a horror movie . This was just dumb .
19511|1|Good performance from Richard Gere cannot even touch upon how horrible this film really is .
19515|1|My son saw this movie on Friday , and says it's not worth the money .
19519|1|Not enough people killed in this one .
19520|1|Generally I've liked the King mini series on television but this one just doesn't live up to past successes like It , Salem's Lot , and to a less extent Storm of the Century . Covering familiar territory with nothing new at the table makes for uninteresting viewing . The casting on this show is weak as well ( I shouldn't even notice that , but I did ) .
19524|1|Couldn't get through 20 m's of this one . AWFUL !
19526|1|Also a TERRIBLE MOVIE !
19541|1|Wicker man ? Whatever .
19546|1|WARNING TO MY LOYAL FANS : This is an art movie , not a sado-slasher movie . Don't even bother clicking the helpful button , guys . I still have 158 horror movies to review !
19547|1|Movie seemed like it was 4hrs long . There were about 3 lines spoken in that4hrs & none of them made sense ! ! ! Great director Terrible movie ! ! Don't waste your brain , just grind it up & make pencil eraseres ! ! ! !
19558|1|Crapola . A shameless rip off of Duel , The Hitcher and just about every other manipulative horror flick of the '90s ( even though this came out in 2001 ) . Roger Ebert gave it four stars . Was he on crack ?
19561|1|I hate this movie . It is not scary whatsoever and the whole plot of the movie is stupid .
19578|1|I fell asleep .
19584|1|This movie sucks ! The only reason anyone went to see it is J . L . H . Who did a good job . In an all around bad movie . Truly just a pop fad movie .
19585|1|It would be better with some sex .
19586|1|I . . . I just don't understand why anyone would give this over one star . Why people cheered for such an atrocity . Scare factor - 0 Suspence factor - 0 Likeable character factor - 0 bad guy you can at least root for because the charactors and actors all suck so bad and add to the overall poonessity of this peice of teeny bopper bubble gum bullsh * t of a movie factor - 0 . Usually if a slasher flick sucks there is at least is a killer to kill off the dorkass teeny kids . In this movie the killer is as big a loser as the kids he's trying to kill ! He gets hung up on a fishing net ? He kills everyone with such ease but can't even catch Jennifer Love Hewitt on his own friggin boat ? AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! ! This is complete and utter poo ! Where are you Michael Myers ? Where did you go Leatherface ? Where is Norman Bates ? These movies are makeing our horror fans stupid ! This is not horror ! It is marketing ! It is makeing money of the naive and makeing fans out of idiots ! But who am I to say . It could be somebodies American Beauty or Exorcist . Anyway , Jennifer Love has definatly mastered the art of the sacred push up bra . Lovely clevage dear . Wish I could say the same for the acting . I'd rather watch teen wolf 2 . Maybe .
19588|1|It's almost embarrasing how bad this horror movie was , because it was liked by teenagers and the critics . Jennifer Love Hewitt was totally silly and unstable in her role , and the rest of the cast was too tired and craweled throughout the whole film .
19606|1|This movie did not make sense and it was pointless . I did not understand the plot .
19616|1|If Stephen King was dead , he'd have rolled over in his grave
19622|1|How can anyone like a movie about a killer car ?
19638|1|Horrid and painful remake of the classic 1950's horror flick . Not even worth reviewing .
19641|1|LAME ! Just another boring canister in which to shove a whole bunch of special effects . The original one was infinately better .
19642|1|How could they waste such a good cast on such a piece of poop movie , such as this !
19643|1|One of the greatest waists of talent , money and time ever made . A huge smack to the face of any contemporary horror fan and any fan of old Hammer films , for this has to be the most god awful remake ever made next to the remake of Night of the Living Dead . You would be better off Watching Bring it on or an equally horrid film like Pearl Harbor . House On Haunted Hill 1999 is pure sh * t . Stay away at all costs .
19653|1|That producers of these atrocities know they will make money on SEQUELS is more horrifying than the movies themselves .
19661|1|Other than the original , none of the others justify more than a 1 .
19692|1|oooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
19695|1|I have yet to see a movie as poorly directed , poorly written , and poorly acted ( except by Jackman ) as this one . I was SO looking forward to it , being a big Universal Monster fan myself . This movie was supposed to be a dream come true . Instead I got a convoluted plot , with mediocre special effects ( a Stephen Sommers tradition ) , and the least believable romanian accents in the history of cinema ( including that guy at the beginning of Eyes Wide Shut ) . This movie should be shown in every film academy throughout the world as a cautionary example of what happens when a GREAT idea is given to a mediocre director who , by the way , believes he can translate said idea into a plot and screenplay . Awful awful awful awful awful awful awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
19706|1|Depp is great , but this film is hollow and cold . I was never at one single point afraid , and it's dragged on about one hour too long . Two Thumbs Way Down .
19707|1|This movie was stupid and had nothing to do with Jack the Ripper .
19716|1|B-O-R-I-N-G .
19717|1|Lame rip-off of several much better movies on the same sort of subject .
19720|1|One of the worst movies I've seen this year . Pathetic . Weak story , weak script , dull characters even though Rufus Sewell is pretty convincing : he was so hateful I wanted to strangle him . Anyway , the SFX are ridiculous , I laughed out loud . It isn't scary at all . . . . sometimes the little girl was quite cool , but it's not enough .
19724|1|Normally , I tend to get prolific when I rate movies , but this there is not much to say about . It ranks with I dreamed of Africa and everything else Basinger has done besides Batman and LA Confidential as absolute garbage . The plot is ludicris , the acting was so coarse and seemingly unrehearsed , and the effects were terrible . Had the director removed the effects and given it a tone more like a Polanski film , it might have been slightly revived . I wish I could given this film no stars .
19745|1|I saw this movie because everyone told me the opening scene was so awesome . When I watched it I laughed . It might have been cool , if it weren't so cheap and campy looking . For me that pretty much set the mood for the entire film . Not only was I not scared through any of it . I found myself laughing through most of it . Bad script , bad acting , and baaaaaaaaad special effects .
19747|1|really bad movie ! starts cool ( wire slicing ) but gets worse and less scary every 10 minutes . i would nt recomend it at all !
19764|1|Lame-o-rama .
19766|1|Almost as funny as Final Destination . This is one of those movies that make you think Don't people bleed after getting stabbed ? . If you're one of those people that think this was a worthless piece of crap . Than i'm proud to say that you're smarter than the jack ass that made the movie .
19769|1|stupid . pointless and unentertaining .
 1977|1|Given the title , pretty amateurish .
19776|1|One of the worst horror movies ever made . Anybody who gives this above 1 star s being very , overly , obscenely generous .
19780|1|The movie starts off right but something goes terribly wrong in the middle . Cyber-Jason ? WTF !
19782|1|It's time to bury Jason once & for all . And this time don't resurrect him . I'd rather stick my head in a grabage can and inhale deeply than sit through another movie like this . Cheesy , cheap & pointless . We have the usual nearly naked girls , some teasing throw in with the slicing and dicing by Jason . I know it's a free country , but we ought to consider a law banning sequels like this .
19786|1|Its just bad . The story is terrible , the acting is very weak . The comedy in the movie wasn't even funny . To the ppl who created this : Plz End yourself
19789|1|Laugh out loud funny . Just goes to show you that no matter what year it is or far the human race has progressed that whenever someone is told to never turn your back on the knife wielding maniac that carves human hides for a hobby than the jack ass is going get stabbed from behind .
19794|1|Clearly a HUGE step down from the quality of the first and surprisingly unentertaining . While I find most Nightmare sequels to be senseless , they are at least entertaining ( except for this one ) .
19795|1|Unfortunatly , all great franchises have one bad movie . Jason had part 8 , Micheal had part 3 , and Freddy has part 2 . The story was bad and the actors sucked !
19798|1|Thank God that Freddy will never be back .
19809|1|This movie was absolutely terrible ! ! ! ! People are dying all over the place , and this moron is listening to reel to reel tapes of some freak with multiple personalities . . oh gawd . . . this movie was a waste of money . dont bother even renting it . When is Hollywood going to produce something worth watching . I want to have the crap scared out of me when I see a HORROR movie , not try to disect what the hell is going on . . . plain boring .
19827|1|this was the stupidest horror movie i have ever seen , it was a while ago , but i can still remember the flat out stupidity of it !
19832|1|A movie was wasted on this useless crossover . Where's my Star Trek vs . Star Wars or Pokemon Meets Tokyo Pig ? Instead , we get a gory , profanity-filled kill fest . Not recommended in the slightest .
19848|1|Good movie for about 5 minutes during the introduction . Goes downhill from there . Saw it for free and still feel cheated .
19853|1|Finally , something worse than Reds .
19866|1|this was terrrible not scary or funny freddie sucks azz in this movie
19867|1|Yea , this is after Freddy became a cartoon of his former scarier self . This sequel though , introduces the new way Freddy takes kids out ! Unlike part one - 3 where if you kill someone in a dream they die that same way in real life ( Tina in part one getting her stomach torn open and thrown all over the room ) part four now introduces this way of killing people where if you do in dream land they either have an asthma attack or pass out into a coma ! Really slack movie . All the characters left from part three die in this one . Gofigure .
19878|1|Im glad I waited till this one came on HBO to see it . . . after the Ring I expected a good movie but it was horrible . I was so disappointed . It had a couple of good " surprise " moments but the overall story was far from unique and the ending left me going " Huh ? I watched this movie for that ? " I don't recommend this one at all !
19888|1|Rip-off of The Rocky Horror Show is neither scary or funny . I would rather watch paint dry than this trash .
19892|1|This is possibly the worst movie ever made and I am ashamed to say that I saw the whole thing . I feel slightly less intelligent after it was finished . Wow .
19896|1|Ah , what a horrible ending to a great story .
19903|1|Scream I loved . Scream 2 was okay . Put this money-grubbing , pointless piece of crap in the back of the bus with Bride Of Chucky . Even the actors look embarrassed to be in the movie . . . Talk about beating a dead horse . . .
19904|1|For the first time I honestly didn't know who was going to be the murderer . So I'll give 'em that . But otherwise . . . The lines left too many question marks unanswered and you never really got into the depth of things . You could almost tell right away who was going to die and it wasn't even scary . I actually laughed when the first few people got killed . It was never really scary 'cause if you had watched the two other movies you had a pretty good idea of what is going to happen next . There was some surprising secrets but not enough .
19906|1|Great minds think alike Mr . Pink .
19907|1|oh my god . as if the first sequel wasn't bad enough , they had to make another scream movie . . oh well , what can you do , right ? a couple of good things though . they brought randy back ( even if it was in a video ) and it was nice to see jay and silent bob , but that was about it . not keeping with the scream tradition , there was only one killer who turned out to be a character whom wich we knew absolutely nothing about and was only introduced to us once . i mean , it could have been anyone , the pissed off brother or john q . walk-on . another thing , where did everyone get those bullet proof vests ? a cute attempt to try and finish off the scream movies , but sorry guys , you failed miserably .
19908|1|Scream 3 is a total waste of your time . There is nothing scary about it , and the ending is so confusing and doesn't connect with anything that you learned from the past 2 . It in fact changes the storyline and confuses you with these silly scripts and bad characters that weren't introduced to us in the past 2 .
 1991|1|Was this supposed to be overflowing with suspense ? * looks about * It's certainly overflowing with something , but suspense it is NOT .
19913|1|STUPID STUPID STUPID ! A so called horror / thriller film trying to be funny does not go over well . Terrible acing from each cast member ! AVOID !
19918|1|This movie sucks ! There was no actual plot , and all the characters seemed fake , and the acting was horrible . This movie was the worst of all three . The whole movie was so bad it was painful to watch .
19927|1|Lisa Bonet's best movie . Also her worst movie . also a terrible move to begin with . Yes dear , your breasts are lovely , obscurity is that way . . .
19970|1|Hated it .
19975|1|Worst horror film ever made , hands down . When a horror movie relies only on CGI computer animation for chills , it is a failure . Computer based images are not scary , because they are transparent and incredibly obviouse . That and the script sucked . The only true horrorfying moments in this movie came from the sh * t dialouge and the idea that a major studio would pump out such garbage that has no redeeming quality . I will never forgive the creators of this film for calling it a horror movie . This is pre packaged cotton candy bull sh * t for the brain dead .
19977|1|Not good at all . Hella sucked too . Much computerized graphics . Story didn't make any sense . Was hella gay and the actors couldn't act at all .
19988|1|Horrible horrible movie . There are few movies that flat out bore me or leave me really disappointed by the end , but this one did . Horrible plot , ridiculous acting and character development and the effects stunk .
19989|1|When will film-makers learn that blood and special effects are NOT SCARY ! Sheesh . This movie was so predictable I could have written it myself . . . . except I write better !
19998|1|I agree with my esteemed henchman , the Mad Hatter . The begining ruled ( got blood all over my best clown suit ) but the rest blew hard .
19999|1|The begining was great but it just went down hill real quick . Pointless plot , murder for kicks , the slow-mo scene of the cop on his knees being executed was drawn out and completly moronic . Rob . . . stick to music .
20004|1|A painful experience . So bad , I asked for my money back on this one . Why ? Just look at the title : 1000 Corpses . AND THERE WERE ONLY 937 ! ! ! ! So WHERE are my CORPSES LITTLE TICKET MAN ? ? ? ? DO YOU WANT TO FEEL MY MENTAL ANGUISH ? ? ? ? I ORDER YOU TO GIVE ME DOUBLE MY MONEY BACK , OR I WILL HAVE BLOOOOOOODD ! ! ! !
20006|1|Absolute nonsense . A substandard ripoff of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
20013|1|The worst one of the entire series !
20014|1|Unfortunately , Jason didn't go to hell and this far gone series is still churning out senseless sequels .
20016|1|The Final Friday is an atrocity . Jason is hardly in it , and the whole only a Vorhees and can kill a Vorhees plot is stupid . Mama Vorhees was killed by an outsider . The only saving graces are Tony the Wonder Llama and the cameo of Freddy's glove . Roll on Freddy Vs . Jason !
20019|1|Ok , Jason . Fine , do you still want to kill people , because if you were a normal killer , you would have retired already and left us alone , because even thr first one wasn't really that good anyways .
20022|1|Is this over yet ? I thought the first one , maybe two were interesting . I was more interested to find out where Jason came from . But please . . haven't we had enough of stupid trollops hanging around in bras and panties in a cabin saying , What's that noise . 'I have a great idea , I will put a rain coat over my scivvies and go trapsing around the pitch black campground with a flashlight that has no batteries and follow that sound of someone screaming and being bludgeoned . ' These movies frustrate me more than anything . I find myself screaming , You dumb naked tramp , don't go into the abandaned outhouse , don't you freakin' see the six by six foot pool of blood you are standing in and your boyfriend's head on the stick in front of you ? !
20025|1|With all the hoopla about this film , I determined to watch it . I'd heard that some viewers in the theater were so frightened that they would vomit , etc . Well now I see why they were vomiting , but it surely wasn't from fright . The vomiting had to come from one of two sources : ( 1 ) bad popcorn or candy , etc . , or ( 2 ) the awful stench emanating from this terrible flick !
20030|1|This was a sorry excuse for a horror movie . They tried to build up the suspense in it , but failed miserably . I frankly couldn't care less what happened to the characters . In fact , throughout the movie I found myself wishing that each of them died a horrible very torturous death . I will admit the camera angle of the very last scene was a cool camera shot . However , that last 10 seconds was about the only redeeming thing about this movie .
20033|1|Not very scary . Blair Witch was boring and somewhat pointless . Not to mention , cheaply made , though that wouldn't necessarily have to detract from the element of horror . This one just didn't do much for a lot of us .
20035|1|Like many of the raters here , I concur that this movie was one of the sorriest ever put out . It was hyped over the Al Gore-invented internet and that led to some fake buzz . I was never scared during the movie ; instead I got madder and madder as I sat through this crap . I wondered how I got took on such bulls * * * it as this ? This worthless piece of junk shouldn't be classified as horror . I've seen home movies with more terror than this . My first hair-cut on camera beat this crap . Thank goodness now everyone knows this & it's crappy sequel are pure junk !
20038|1|Everyone thinks this movie was based on a true story . Trouble is , It wasn't . There was no real blair witch legend in Burkittsville , Maryland . There was no local witch named Elly Kedward either . She was actually just a young Irish immigrant who wasn't even from that area ! Eileen Treacle did not drown in Tappy East Creek . Her mother murdered her in 1864 . Tappy East Creek does not exist . There is no Black Hills Forest in Maryland . There's no 'Coffin Rock' either . Sadly , Blair Witch is fake as they come .
20039|1|I was pretty disappointed to learn that the whole thing had been improvised . The swearing wasn't a problem because they were actors doing improv ( making it up as they go ) and that's what most young people do when they are angry , upset or frustrated .
20041|1|This is definately one of the worst horror movies ever made . . . and the budget of this movie isn't the only thing to blame for it either . Bad acting , bad script , bad scenery . Hated it ! It will literally make you vomit if you are a car sick type individual .
20045|1|The whole movie gave me a complete headache . The movie was so ultra-boring and the ending was like a wtf ending .
20046|1|I am thinking of taking my camcorder and recording the Friday night drunken brawls , over at our local bar . At least my movie would make more sense . I firmly beleive that this was the start of all the reality shows we now see on TV . . . bleeech . .
 2005|1|I am disappointed at this movie . It's not scary AT ALL ! ! ! The plot is week and Ford's acting is a joke ( as usual ) . Pfeiffer did well tho . Still , the movie is not worth watchin .
20053|1|It sucked . save yourself the trouble , dont bother to see it .
20060|1|What the hell were they thinking ? ? ? ? ? This movie totally sucks ! Watching my cat crap tripples the fun of this bull !
20063|1|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat . . . . waiting for something to happen . It never did . The dialog consisted mostly of the F word , used once every 10 . 44 seconds . I learned that , even I could be offended by this language when exposed to it long enough . Basically , if you take 11 seconds out of the center of the movie and put it in a continuous play loop , you've got the whole thing . Stupid dialog about 3 stupid people who go into the woods with a map they can't read and a compass they don't know how to use . They have no survival skills whatsoever . Any ordinary person threatened by a 'whatever-it-was' would hopefully sharpen a couple branches and make a spear or dagger , or fashion some kind of weapon . And what's up with all the filming while they're 'running for their lives' ? I don't mean to pick on the lack of realism because this is fiction , but these people were so moronic that I was actually cheering for the 'whatever-it-was' to get them so they couldn't eventually reproduce . I understand what this movie was trying to accomplish ; fear of the unknown . It missed the mark by a mile . It could have worked , but it didn't . It was boring , repetitive , had dialog consisting almost entirely of F--- and left me with a burning desire to call my Congressman and demand more funding for education . I hope the $ 30 , 000 cost for this movie was spent on expensive lunches . Otherwise , it was wasted .
20065|1|This is the worst scary movie I have ever seen . It was way over-hyped , with reports that grown men were leaving the theaters with heart attacks and you couldn't sleep without a light on for weeks . . . well , these stories had to be fake because this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen . Too much talking and angry screaming . . . not to mention the over-use of the F-Word . . . I mean , cussing is okay , to some extent , but when you hear it used every other word in a movie it gets tiresome . The whole witch thing seemed very unrealistic . I couldn't buy the idea that a witch was following the group , but the events that happened to the group seemed more like the work of local pranksters , which made the movie very , very un-scary . The ending was terrible . It was confusing and left me with a feeling of unsatisfaction . And the stupid camera movement makes you really sick to your stomach . It gave me a headache after a while . Don't waste your time with this movie . . . it's not worth the money and the hour and a half of your life it takes to watch it .
20070|1|This movie was a rip off ! The only thing that i will say was good in this movie was the ending . Other than that it gave me a headache .
20072|1|It is almost impossible to watch a movie objectively . The viewer brings with him / her , consciously or not , expectations and personal feelings which it is absolutely impossible not to apply to what he / she is watching . This is as it should be . A film I love , others may hate . A film I think is one of the worst ever made , a lot of other people may enjoy . I'll give you an example : I think The Blair Witch Project is one of the worst ever made ! A lot of other people enjoyed it . See how it works ? I , too , heard the hype . I couldn't wait to see this movie , and actually the first two times I tried , it was sold out . I finally had to go to an afternoon matinee . After I saw the movie , I was more confused than annoyed . I had heard it was scary , terrifying , and so on . Had I seen a different cut of the movie ? Maybe I fell asleep without knowing it and missed the scary stuff ? So I went to see it again . Then , once more , on home video months later , JUST to make sure . Nope . Still not scary . To me , anyway . It's a simple idea , and would seem to have the potential to be scary : 3 young student filmmakers went to Burkettsville , Maryland , formerly ( This is not fact , but fiction invented by the makers of Blair Witch , though Burkettsville itself is real ) called Blair , to make a documentary on the Blair Witch , a settler in colonial times by the name of Elly Kedward who supposedly practiced witchcraft . After being exiled from the Blair settlement to die in the woods , she apparently caused a plague to wipe out most of the children in Blair . Hundreds of years later , she is believed by some to still be roaming the woods , causing mayhem and horror aplenty , including inducing a crazy hermit who lived in the woods in the 1940's to kidnap some children and kill them in his basement . They interviewed various locals , then set off into the woods . They became lost . They were victimized at night by strange sounds and someone or something that made little piles of stones outside their tent . One of them disappeared . The remaining two were victimized some more , then they went to the crazy old hermit's abandoned house , dropped their cameras and disappeared themselves . Their footage was found several years later , pasted together and this is what we are watching . This is all well and good . It even has creepy potential . Obviously , something about it was frightening to a lot of people , so what I am about to say is my own opinion , and should not stop anyone from checking out this movie if they are interested . I thought the whole thing played flatly . I found the three non-actors playing the students irritating . They bicker , scream and swear throughout , with no variation on the theme . Despite the implications of the little piles of rocks found outside the tent each morning or the stick figures found hanging from trees , I did not , personally , find these things threatening . If these three jerks were that hot to find out who was putting them there , why not turn off the lights in the tent and stay awake , watching ? The noises heard at night in the woods were nebulous , at best . Anyone who has ever gone camping will tell you that the night woods are full of all sorts of strange sounds : breaking sticks , limbs falling , things moving around , even cries that sometimes sound human . I won't complain , as some have , about the jerkiness of the camerawork , because to be fair this is supposed to be raw footage shot by people who were walking through the woods and just filming each other . What I will comment on , though , is the stupidity of the notion that , in the extremity of their terror , . . . alone , lost , hunted . . . as the girl in the funny knit cap so famously intones , her nose running into the camera , even kids as moronic as these would keep filming . Were this as authentic an experience as the makers of this borefest would like us to think it is , these dorks would have dropped the cameras and just started running until they either found their way out of the woods or just keeled over ! I will say that the last ten minutes or so of the movie , when the two remaining wonks find the murderous hermit's old house and go inside has a certain amount of tension in it , though considered after the fact , the tension is caused almost entirely by what could potentially happen , rather than by anything that does . That , to me , is the big problem with the whole movie . It represents an hour and a half , give or take , of missed opportunities . And just out of curiosity-since this film represents three dimbulbs shooting footage of their every waking moment while lost in the woods over a three day period , why is only one of them seen going to the bathroom , and then only once ? Wouldn't schmucks like these show their limited wit by taking every opportunity to sneak up on one another with the camera during private moments ? Would have made the film more interesting , at least for me .
20078|1|I didn't understand the hype surrounding this movie . I found it to be very tasteless , and nauseating from the camera movement .
20083|1|This was not a scary movie . There was no plot . Kids running around the woods is not a plot . The big climax at the end was a let down . The audience never even got to see the Blair Witch . Plus , the movie made me physically sick from the shaky camera .
20088|1|To me , it was a stupid movie . A movie has to have action and drama . Most of the time the camera was on the trees or the ground .
20090|1|I hate this movie . Can someone say boring ? This is the most boring movie I ever watched . I got a fat headache from the camera's movements . Talk about a waste of seven bucks .
20095|1|From the previews it seemed pretty good , but when I saw it I thought it was terrible and it seemed fake . I was sitting down , waiting for something to happen and at the very end , I thought something was going to happen and it didn't . I hated it .
20100|1|It wasn't even scary , nothing in the movie to me would even classify as a horror movie . The best part of the movie sucked , and that was supposed to be the best scene in the movie .
20102|1|This movie hella sucked . I thought it was going to be hella scary , but it wasn't . Maybe I expected too much out of it . This movie made me hella dizzy .
20103|1|I thought it was awful . I don't understand what everyone was going all crazy for . It was really stupid , and a waste of time and money . There's really nothing to be scared about . It wasn't even a little bit frightening .
20104|1|I rated this movie a 1 because it looked so fixed and fake ! I'd have to admit that some parts freaked me out , but as I read magazines and stuff it made it look so fake and fixed .
20108|1|It was a waste of time and money . I got dizzy .
20114|1|Did not understand the movie . Was very boring and not enough excitement . When it got to the end , the good part , the movie ended .
20120|1|HORRIBLE ! ! ! ! NICE WASTE OF FILM . THANK GOD I DID NOT SEE THIS A THE SHOW . If you buy a DVD player you should get this movie for free . Rates A 10 on the GAY METER .
20142|1|The Blair Witch Project has got to be without doubt the greatest waste of an 90 minutes or so of my life . Complete tripe ! ! !
20156|1|. . . and I still know its terrible .
20159|1|. . . And I still don't care . . . Die already . . .
20164|1|CHRIST ALL MIGHTY ! WHAT A PEICE OF COW DUNG ! ! ! ! If the original IKWYDLS was not enough to send you home rushing to the vomit bag , then this should do the trick . There is no reason to see this movie . It is boring and totally unbelievable . This picture even holds itself above the audience by believing that we don't know the capial of Africa . What ? Are we all morons ! We are intelligent film goers . If you have any self respect , stay far away from this wet fart of a movie .
20169|1|Man . . . I have never been so let down by a movie . Considering , that I wanted to love this move . . . since the original Exorcist is my favorite horror flick of all time . I almost gave this movie 2 stars because it did make me laugh in certain supposed scary parts . Before I commented on this , I tried to think of ways to make this at least . . . at least 2 stars . I just couldn't do it . This was a horrible , boring , dragged out piece of garbage .
20180|1|Thank GOD Freddie is dead ! Now we have to look forward to Jason vs . Freddie . Yeeee Haawwww ! ! !
20189|1|Pure crap !
20190|1|Let's get real , folks : This may be a trendy cult favorite , but as strictly a horror movie , it sucks . Bad .
20198|1|Are you kidding me ? The effects and the acting were so lame I almost took razors to my wrists ! This movie is moronic and dull to say the least .
20200|1|just awfal this is the same director as urban legends yes urban legends was not great but it was fun and entertaing this movie really is stupid the only good scene is when the sexy girl is in a bikini and gets killed in the hot tub i would have never guesse the killer was going to do but ather than that this movie sucks do not waste youre time watch halloween friday the 13th a nightmare on elm street scream i know what you did last summer or urban legends this movie is not good
20203|1|I hate to keep using sucks to describe movies , but as long as they keep churning out this crap I'll use the term . I can't believe Angel lowered himself to star in this hopeless garbage . Did they really think that guys would watch this just because they threw Denise Richards in , along with a bevvy of other good-looking girls ? Tell me that we're not that shallow .
20205|1|Boring and predictable . Anyone could have figured out the entire plot in the first ten minutes . A stupid waste of $ 7 . 50 . Too bad , though . This could have been a great plot . Bad writing and acting doomed this one .
20208|1|Correct me if I am wrong , but , in most horror movies , isn't it the general consensus that we want the protagonist ( s ) to get away from the evil killer ? I think that is the only respect in which Valentine differs from stupid horror movie fare . You actually want these horrid actors to die . Even though the deaths were really disapointing . I suppose the idea in itself is meritorus , but it just came out to be a jumbling mixture of over and under acting , at-times confusing plotline , not to mention the pathetic killer . The murderer is suppose to invoke within the viewer a sense of tense watchfulness . Who will be next ? How will they die ? In Valentine , one just sits there , not really caring who dies and how ( except for when it's really funny like when that crazy guy dies by iron ) . All in all , I ( big surprise ) have to say that I do not recommend this movie . Well not if you want to be scared , at any rate . If you want to have a laugh at the expense of a crappy film , well then by all means .
20209|1|WELCOME ! To horror movie hell . Hehe . I don't have three days to spend listing the flaws of this movie so I will just brush over the top . First it is by the guy who did the equally terrible Urban Legend . His visual styling is cute and all but it can't save these poo poo scripts . The characters are all inept and unlikeable . You honestly want them all to die horrible deaths . The deaths start out good but then as if it were a kiddie film just turn into sell out deaths and leave you with dull boring and unimaginitive deaths . Like when a certain big breasted bimbo gets trepped in the hot tub by a sheet ao hard reenfirced plastic and the killer is drilling down at her the killer gives up after 15 seconds and tosses the drill into the tub , electocuting her . Whoopdy doo ! Haven't seen that before . Not even haveing the beautiful work of the Deftones on the soundtrack can help this peice o trash flick out . The ending and last death is really quit funny . Go see it if you are really bored and like disapointment . Would you hide in a body bag ? And if the killer began stabbing the contense of every bag in that room would you stay perfectly still or run for it ? Like I said , these are some stoopid ass kids .
20211|1|This 'nightmare' should have never even made it to theatres . . . it was completely horrific and not in a good horror movie way . . .
20214|1|Freddy Freddy go away , come back to hollywood another day . With movies so stupid , so boring and silly , I always thought that your series was a pity . You are so mental , so crazy and wild , and now we have to go through the tourchure , of seeing your child ?
20216|1|I actually saw them film part of this movie in Boonton , NJ , in 1983 . Not that that predisposed me toward liking it ; I thought the finished product was a horrible piece of garbage . I'm all for encouraging the making of low-budget movies , especially low-budget horror movies , but there needs to be a requisite amount of talent and imagination involved in the formation of said low-budget movies , or why waste everybody's time ? Not even entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way . If you're a hard-core masochist in search of punishment , go see an Ed Wood movie instead of this tripe . . .
20217|1|This movie sucked-its neither a horror movie or a comedy !
20236|1|This is probably the second worst movie I've seen in a long time . I watched it with two other people and they both thought the same . The storyline is bad , simple-minded , and unexploited . The characters were weak , and the supporting actresses / actors were bad . The action / fighting scenes weren't very good either . But that's not even the worst part . The dialogue was literally laughable ( the sort you would expect from a weak story-lined action movie ten years ago ) . Here's one example : Let's just kick some ass ! It's what we do best . Even the background music was dis-tasteful , imagine theme music from the game Quake 2 , except much much worse . I would recommend saving your money and not going to see this one . . . if anything wait until it comes out on video .
20238|1|sucked
20244|1|1 cuz the tommy guy was hot . otherwise id give it a 0 !
20245|1|Without hesitation , the very worst of all the film Fridays . The acting is particularly horrible , as is the plot . The ending is not surprising at all , and the viewer doesn't care for one second about any of the characters . The only thing it's got going for it is the gratuitous nudity , which is more present in this film than in any other Friday .
20253|1|Sorry to say this but the first one was way better , never should been made in the first place .
20259|1|Stupid . Illogical . A Dracula that at one point can't be killed by the sunlight but then later he can ? Very illogical . Very predictable . Gerard Butler was nice to look at , but that's about it . To the movie's credit it did base around the little know Judeo-Christian theory of Dracula's Origin , and explains several things associated with Dracula ( stake through the heart , silver , etc ) . However , it wasn't scary or suspensful and was actually very stupid . Dracula in New Orleans , please . It is no wonder most of the actors in this film havent' worked since this disaster .
20264|1|pure crap .
20266|1|I used to be able to say I Know What You Did Last Summer was the worst horror movie ever . At least it tried to develope characters , tried to be interesting , tried to be original . This film misses every beat and fails at even being a movie worth pissing on . If anything I laughed myself silly whenever Dracula himself showed up . He reminded me of Neo from the Matric . Does every actor have to over and under act ? There is no middle ground acting wise in this film . This movie only succeeding in taking my money . Now I am a messanger . If you have a taste for unintintionaly funny movies go for it . If you want a good hunk of horror , go rent the Shinning .
20267|1|This movie sucked ! I don't recommend it at all . First of all , it is sooo fake . . . I mean this stuff is soo unreal its not funny . Yea , there are times where you will jump or be scared , but I'd hardly call it a horror movie . More like WIERD !
20276|1|This movie turned me off in the first 10 minutes . The movie was grotesque and stupid , the story , well , there was no story really . If you like meaningless gore , watch til your hearts content , otherwise avoid this movie like the disease it is about .
20281|1|Honestly , the movie was more boring than scary .
20283|1|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . There's nothing more here than a lot of violence and NO story . Worst of 2003 .
20284|1|This is by far the worst movie I have seen so far in 2003 ! I would have walked out of this one had my date not asked me to stay . I mean honestly people , do not waste your time . The previews look really , really good . But it is nothing like them ! It is depressing , and downright gross .
20289|1|whis is the most stupidest movie ever the things are so fake freddy krueger oew makes me want to hurl the movies nasty and terrible who could watch such a devil movie
 2029|1|What Lies Beneath was a terrible movie which attempted to be scary but failed miserably . The movie blatantly foreshadowed everything that was going to happen , insulting the audience . The used classic techniques which gave everything away .
20294|1|I think this is beyond all bounds the worst of the Child Play franchise . The only frightning moments in this peice were the parts that had people trying to act and the horrible dialogue is spoken . The low production costs and crap idea make this one of the worst Child's Play movies and one of the worst horror films ever made . Complete poo .
20305|1|Over complicated plot , bad script , and dreadful SFX . Ottman must have been on dope to direct this thing
20307|1|This was so bad I was cheering the bad guy on . Horrible acting . Does not live up to the original .
20308|1|You may not find this review helpful , but all I can say is this film was the biggest insult to a film lover ever . It shouldn't have been , since it was the most contrived slasher movie I have ever seen , but still , its stupidity makes you feel good about yourself , and bad about Hollywood , and the human race .
20309|1|Okay I love horror movies but this movie was really bad . How many times can a movie repeat the whole scream killer sequence . Every killer has to have this long reason on how they kill but none of it makes sense now . Scream is a great movie ! ! urban legend was alright but what the hell were they thinking making a sequel . I wanna laugh in the face of the director because it is so bad the only person who saves it is the kid that is in me , myself and irene and is the effects maker in the movie . Oh before I forget Pam Grier woman cop I love you ! ! This is an insult to all horror fans and an insult to all movie-goers .
20310|1|What a waste . I have seen some terrible horror films in my day but for thr the love of Pete ! this has got to the worst horror film in years and that is saying alot . Not only is the casting crap but the throw back to Alfred Hitchcock at the end made me want to choke the film maker . For them to think this movie could even be comparable to a Hitchcock masterpeice is beyond me . Deplorable and a joke to the horror movie fans . Watch it and be prepared for a boring evening .
20312|1|The first one was terrible . . . why in God's name did they bother to do a sequel ? ? ? ? ?
20314|1|oh my god ! they should of called it friday the 13th part 8 jason goes down with the ship jason does not take manhattan the muppets did a better job in the muppets take manhattan but this is the worst sequel i mean what the hell was with that makeup job on jason so hokey and why did jason talk and why did jason turn into a little kid the new title Friday the 13th part 8 the muppets take manhattan
20315|1|I have an idea for a part IX : Jason comes on to the set filming the latest abomination , and kills off everyone , starting with the director and producer , and ending with the actors as they're putting on makeup .
20319|1|Unquestionably the worst sequel out of the entire series ( with the possible exception of Jason X ) . The acting was horrible , the plot was idiotic , and the music was stupid . This movie really had some potential as I was happy to see it take place somewhere other than the camp itself , and the beginning was OK , but the end was so stupid it makes me wonder how the filmmakers could ever live with themselves .
 2032|1|I hated it . It sucked dick . I really hated it . I liked it when they had sex . I liked a lot of the crazy stuff .
20320|1|what can i say , this is at the top of my worst sequels list , right next to urban legends , final cut , i still know what you did last summer , and halloween 3 . ok , its jason takes manhattan , yet the entire movie takes place on a cruise ship exept at the end when they drift ashore on manhatton . the last 20 min . of the movie is in manhattan . it was cute when the black guy got his head blocked off , but honestly , if a couple of punks were giving jason sh * t , would jason really just show them his face ? this movie was a travesty to the friday the 13th series . besides , jason looks so decayed in this movie that a stiff breeze would take him out . this movie sucks !
20322|1|Weak and stupid . worst horror sequel next to Halloween 3 . This film sucks .
20323|1|I hate Jason movies . Way too sick . Who wants to see an idiot killing teenagers ?
20325|1|Terrible doesn't describe how BAD this movie is ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! One of the worst I've seen !
20333|1|What the F * * * was Carpenter thinking when he spun the series in this direction . He didn't just change direction with this turd , he totally derailed the franchise . The worst horror movie ever .
20334|1|This movie was the worst movie ever ! ! ! It shouldn't really even be included in the Halloween Michael Myers series . This movie didn't make any sense what so ever .
20335|1|This was the worse of the series . No micheal myers what so ever and has nothing to do with the series .
20336|1|The worst movie of all time !
20337|1|A true horror movie that made me sick to my stomach . It wasn't because of blood and gore , it was the whole thing about killing children on Halloween . The movie is just sick . . .
20339|1|This one doesn't have a thing to do with Michael Myers , and it sucks . But it doesn't suck because he's not in it , it sucks because it sucks ! I mean , it's really bad . It's not scary , it's just plain bad . The people who made this film must have had some serious issues with children . It didn't scare me at all , just left me with a bad feeling .
20345|1|What the hell were they thinking ? ? ? I saw this movie assuming I would get to see Myers in action . Instead I get a stupid movie about halloween masks and the most annoying count down to Halloween ever !
20352|1|aaaahhhhhhh , the most overrated movie of the year , it wasnt scary at all , this is a spoiler but i dont care , THERE ARE NO MOSNTERS IN THE FORREST , IT IS THE VILLAGE ELDERS DRESSING UP , IT IS SO FREAKING STUPID , THEY ARE IN A WILDLIFE REFUGE OUTSIDE OF MODERN DAY PHILADELPHIA , DONT SEE IT , I JUST RUINED IT FOR YOU ANYWAYS AND HOPEFULLY SAVED YOU MONEY ! ! ! !
20355|1|A cheap attempt at Urban Legends , Scream or a I know clone . This movie was rented as a free rental and the clerk refunded my money for the tape i paid for ! This should tell you all you need to know .
20356|1|terrible one of the worst
20360|1|another movie on the sequel craze .
20365|1|Wretched . Makes the first three films look like classical masterpieces .
20368|1|Cheesy sequel that offers nothing . Why do they make sequels that are so terrible that they ruin an entire seres ?
20369|1|Giving this movie one star makes the other one star movies look bad . Possibly the worst horror movie ever made . Terrible . Awful . Pathetic . Pick your own synonyms .
20373|1|I think this movie was very stupid . I think the writers got carried away . As if the 1st and second movie weren't bad enough they had to add a 3rd . Now is this movie really considered a horror or what ? I'd call it a joke . It made me shake my head instead of grabbing my seat . How about the part of not needing a condom because it's all rubber baby . How dumb .
20375|1|This movie sucked ! That's all I can say . It was a funny idea in the 80's , but now it's just redundant . I didn't see one good thing in the movie . Terrible script , directing and acting . I hated this movie .
20380|1|One of the worst movies ever made why did the dolls have sex that was just plain stupid and this movie wasnt even scary
20383|1|Good Lord , help us all . The first movie should NOT have been made , therefore , the sequel was extremely unnecessary and the THIRD one should have been against the law . I believe it was a dreary Sunday afternoon that my husband was channel surfing and stopped on this ridiculous movie . Yes , I watched it . . I needed a brain dead day , and this movie fit the bill . I do not need to see My Buddy Dolls doing the deed ( very odd scene ) . Overall , the movie is the worst movie ever made .
20386|1|This movie was very stupid . I did not understand it . They had dolls having sex , and it was just a plain terrible movie .
20391|1|This movie sucked on so many levels . But if you happen to enjoy bad films and like wasting your life hours at a time . Then you'll love Bones .
20392|1|Oh Snoop Dogg . You are no Whitney Houston . You're not even the Spice Girls . You are just one horrid actor . Bones is basically the same exact film as Blacula , but instead it has a rap soundtrack and is set today . Dogg is horrible in the title role , and his female co-stars provide nothing . Eeek .
20394|1|I hate saying it , but not even Snoop Dogg and is great personality could save this sad , sorry , tired piece of trash . So fast paced it's rushed , so poorly written it reads like a Dick and Jane book . Characters so thin they are translucent . Blood so orange it looks like buffalo wing sauce . You cannot help but not feel for any character in this film they are so run of the cheese mill . Snoop is fun to watch but gave a much better performance in the recent film , Training Day , which showcased a more talented side . This is just Snoop having fun with the little he is givin . Jimmy Bones comes back seeking vengence against those who betrayed him years past . He comes back and kills them all in fifteen , maybe twenty minutes . No build up . No suspence . No one cares . He then wants to continue lovin his girl played by Pam Grier and start a relationship with his daughter of which he never had a chance to meet because he got killed . Lame as hell and just plain bad , Bones should crawl up and be put back in it's grave . Poor ol , Snoop .
20396|1|One of the stupidest and least scary horror movies I've ever seen . It was almost as bad at Battlefield Earth .
20397|1|I came out of the theatre crying that I wanted those wasted minutes of my life back .
20400|1|Turds on a stick stink less than this movie and have more substance . . . and corn .
20401|1|crapdotcom would have been a title more fitting .
20402|1|Rip off
20404|1|I made an honest effort to enjoy it , but in the end I had no idea what the hell the whole point of the film was . I'm still trying to make sense of it .
20405|1|www . fear . com / sucksbigmonkeynuts . html
20407|1|Terrible movie , this aint horror it's retarded .
20409|1|This was probably the very worst movie I ever saw .
20411|1|After getting stung on the first one , why would you ever view the second ? Well I was a sucker and watched it . OUCH !
20414|1|You said it genghis ; fool me once shame on you - fool me twice shame on me . But , if you did shell out actual cash to see this - please email me - I have this really cool white plastic 8 Track player - with car lighter adapter that I'll be happy to sell you .
20417|1|The only scary thing about the film is the fact that it was made in the first place .
20418|1|I haven't seen Part II of the Blair Witch Project but I'm going to predict that it's just as lousy as the first one . Like The Others this gem needs to be removed from the horror category
20419|1|Bad movie with bad characters . I guess they were tired with the angry black man character and decided to go with the angry wiccan . There was no blair witch it was the brain dead tourists that killed those people and for some reason they're all too dumb to remember anything . Don't think of it as having the ending ruined . Think of it as having two hours of your life saved .
20421|1|wow really dissapointed : (
20429|1|why make a 2 when one wasn't that good . plot was bad a waste of time and money
20430|1|i would like to share my opinion . . . . i bought the first BW video before renting an saw it because my brother age 19 at the time said it was good it scared him to death well to be honest i hated it , i was so furious about how bad it sucked , in all my life ive never seen a movie more worse then that . . . . . so im extremely reluctant to even seeing the second one yet just earlier last year i did a little research an im not sure yet til i have proof to back this up but it could very well be that the first BW wasnt a movie , it was a real film documentary , suppose to be realistic , real life not fake . . . . . once i have actual proof of this ill share it with you all . . . . . after seeing the first one i did get online an write to anyone i could regarding this movie an expressed my complete regretfulness for even buying the movie , expressed how horrible i felt it was . . . .
20435|1|There's no reason to even comment on this movie . It is horrible . You are making a huge mistake if you go see it .
20436|1|Atually , I'm a big fan of TBWP . . . After watched the first TBWP , i always try to find the conclusion . I think all of you , want it too . Is that right ? Suddenly , when i heard the news 'bout the next blair witch ( BW 2 ) , my heart start pushing me to buy the movie . . . . But finally , after watching the BW 2 . . . . i felt regret . . . It is because the movie is sick . . . suck . It just wasted my money . Before buying the movie . . i think that the movie will start at the Rustun Parr's house but is not . i would like to suggest that the next BW will continue from the Rustin Parr's house and make a conclusion ( whatever it's true or not ) . Keep up a good work . . . .
20438|1|I recently made a huge mistake . I went to see Blair Witch 2 . I saw the first one and it was pretty good , so I figured I might as well go and see the sequel . It was horrible . The characters were weak , there was no plot , no motive , no anything . I've never fallen asleep during a horror movie before , but this time I found myself struggling to stay awake . The movie made absolutely no sense . Words simply cannot express how bad this movie was . It was a waste of $ 7 . 00 , and I would'nt mind if the people behind this movie never did anything else ever again . If you thought the ending to the first Blair Witch was bad , wait until you see this one . I can't beleive I actually waisted my time and money on that garbage . Movies like this discourage me from ever going to the movies again . I've never been more pissed off at a movie than I was at this one . I'm just going to stop talking about it before I get angry . BLAIR WITCH 2 SUCKS ! I beg others to go out and see this horrible movie so you can give some reviews about it . It would be nice to know if other people can also recognize bad movies when they see them , so I don't end up thinking I'm crazy .
20439|1|This movie is horrible . A movie about dumb cheerleaders being killed . Enough Said ! !
20440|1|A bunch of cheerleaders get massacred . Who the f * * k pays money to watch this s * * t ?
20445|1|One word , BAD . Imagine Gremlins but not scary or funny in the least .
20446|1|this is a remake of the texas chainsaw masscre shame on you renne zellweger for showing up for the first day of shooting
20448|1|With a great cast who would have thought this movie could be soooo bad !
20449|1|masturbate
20514|1|No offense . . . but I thought this was really stupid . The whole plot was pretty pathetic , and the acting wasn't good either . I see it has lots of really good reviews . . I just can't really believe that . Correct me if I'm wrong--this is the one where a girl goes back in time to find a dinosaur egg , or something like that ? It was really bad .
20523|1|You're kidding me right ?
20529|1|THEY SUCK , and MIC's got a BIG mouth . GREAT FOR COCK SUCKING . . . . .
 2054|1|this is nothing more than a made for TV cheapie with 2 big stars . truly bad movie and soooooo predictable . I want my money back ! ! !
20540|1|This was the lamest Imax movie I have every seen . It is in 3D , so you must wear these big glasses on your head that hundreds of people before you have sweated in .
20546|1|Worst sporting event ever ! I was told that a Nascar event was the place to see hot tail , sadly I was mistaken . The women looked like what I expected them to look like and whats up with the confederate flag ? I tried to watch it because I heard it was so exciting , but I feel asleep on lap 20 ! I think to enjoy Nascar , you need to be intoxcicated , and I felt that these drivers were trying to hard to act like tough guys . Hey buttholes , stop wasting our precious fuel and stop calling yourselves athletes . If they're athletes , everyone who drives a car , truck , or a bus is an athlete ! When is the last time you looked at a bus driver and thought that this guy is the Michael Jordan of bus driving ? Never ! Plus , Nascar never goes off on time , so it causes me to miss my favorite show The Simpsons . I just want to race daddy I just want to race !
20549|1|I was expecting lots of high quality IMAX racing action . Very little racing . Lots of behind the scenes stuff I could have seen on TV . Very disappointed
20553|1|What was the IMAX thinking ?
20554|1|N'Sync are nothin' but puppets . Anyone who likes this is probably an assclown .
20555|1|Yuck . They suck . And what's with the title copying BSB's Larger Than Life ? Do they EVER do anything original ? ? ?
20593|1|I hated West Side Story . It was so boring and so mindless . The acting was terrible , and there was like not one single thing that I liked about this movie !
20609|1|A truly bad movie-with one of the most annoying soundtracks EVER . Once on a job , the only music playing was this soundtrack over and over-when I finally spoke up and offered to get another tape out of my car I was loudly cheered by everyone in the building . People were literally ready to walk off the job !
20610|1|I worked at a grocery store with a video rental shop . The lady that worked there always played this movie , over and over again . I hated it . I can not stand this movie .
20613|1|Why this piece of cinimatic pablum ever became a hit is beyond me . The story line is boring and John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John waddle through the script . I have only seen it once or twioce , and that was once or twice to many !
20661|1|Hate it so much . I don't know why people like it . So awful . .
20669|1|Grease is such an overrated movie . It's absolutely horrible and John Travolta is lame .
 2067|1|I hte werewolves and I hate salt and vineger pringles . Once i pop I just cant stop puking . this movie was stupid . Alls im saying is if you really wanted to blow people to crap it wouldnt be as difficult as they make it seem . uuuh rahhhh anarchist cookbook
20682|1|The Sound of Mucus is more like it . Who is the world finds Julie Andrews at all appealling or entertaining ? Gadzooks , she's one of the worst : I feel like I'm going to fall into a diabetic coma everytime she comes into the frame . Christopher Plumber , a truly gifted actor who's been gravely overlooked for decades , puts in a fine performance for a guy who's hardly the song and dance type , yet he doesn't actually sing or dance much in this flick . The children are obnoxious . The story is one of those typical Hollywood based on a true story feel-good bowel movements . There are a few decent songs in the score , but most of it is your usual musical filler . This was such a popular flick when it first came out , but looking at it today , it's hard to determine why . Of course , it's bland and easily digestible family fare , but please , it's so hokey and goody-goody that you just want to barf .
20690|1|This has got to be one of the worst watses of 2 hours i have ever spent . Not only was this movie boring its songs live on forever . They are the scourge of mankind . The absolute worst . Just seemed way too phony .
 2072|1|Just amplified my belief that Keanu Reeves is the worst . actor . ever .
20720|1|Although the movie is nearly devoid of objectionable content ( aside from the occasional profanity ) , there are two things that absolutely destroy the movie . First , the songs are extremely grating and annoying . Second , the sexism in this production is outrageous . No more is this obvious than the shockingly-inappropirate ending . The ending is completely different than the short story , Pygmmalion , that this 1964 movie is based on . I just can't recommend this production .
20777|1|When will these sugary old-farty musicals end ? Please ! This movie is way too cheesy for my tastes . The singing made me ears hemmorhage ! Bing Crosby is a terrible singer and not good to look at . Overall , this musical is as fun as anencephaly .
 2080|1|Terrible , terrible movie . Why ? The acting is the worst i have seen of any movie ever . The plot makes it even worse . Who wants to watch a movie where it is around the bus all day ?
20803|1|Very undeserving of all the acclaim .
20805|1|My wife and I thought the movie was so bad and so boring , we walked out and got our money back . And then what happens ? It wins big at the Acadamy Awards ! We couldn't get over it . Maybe we were crazy , I don't know , but I stand by my original opinion . Maybe I'll rent it and give it another try .
20807|1|There must have been some sort of mass hysteria in Hollywood when the powers that be annointed this dog as a great movie . It isn't even good . Thank God I saw it on video and not in a theater or I would have walked out . A crashing bore .
20814|1|Oh my god . This piece of crud was the most overhyped and overated thing I ever seen . Renee Zellwegger needs to leave the singing business . The music score was terrible . Catherine Zeta Jones can not dance or sing at all . She needs to stick to speaking roles . As for Queen Latifah , She was well in her role , but she's the only good thing that happened to this movie . Seriously , none of the characters are likable . Roxie Heart is as pretty as a donkey's vas deferens and as talented at singing as a screeching bat .
20821|1|What a lovely message to send to kids . Kill people and get famous . Oh , How wonderful ! Yes , Little Susie ! Yes , Little Vinny ! Yes , Little Jamal ! Let's all go out and have sex with people for fame , Then shoot them ! What a wonderful message ! BTW , I'm being sarcastic .
20823|1|people think that because they take a cow ( Renee Z ) and stuff her in a dress and teach her to dance , that they have an instant hit , way overated
20862|1|I have never liked this movie , and wish it wuld just go away . John Ravolta ( no , that is not a TYPO ! ) is the most annoying actor of all time . he can't act , and can't dance . How this movie is considered a classic is beyond me !
20864|1|Oh enough already ! This isn't 1977 anymore . After reading NaturallyYou's review I felt like I was in a DISCO HELL time warp . Give me a break . . . . You Should Be Dancing , Jive Talkin . . . . man please ! Stereo types and abusing women was fever the producer had in making film for the gutter !
 2090|1|Speed was the worst action / thriller movie I have ever witnessed . The plot was shallow and the acting was horrendous . After viewing this movie , I wish I could have gotten my money back . It shouldn't be sold . That , as well as Speed II .
 2092|1|It's no wonder why Sandra Bullock has disappeared from the movie screen a bit . The film that made her a star was the worst of its year . In the movie a bus in manipulated by a terroist , who for some reason finds it necessary to put a bomb on it , so that if it reaches over ( or was it over ? ) 50 mph it will explode . Great , all we need is another cheesy-ass wanna be adventure movie with Keanu Reeves .
20921|1|Ludicrously overrated . Jarring , jangling , and incoherent . And none of the music is even original !
20924|1|Hated this movie ! ! ! ! The biggest waste of my time .
20946|1|I am sorry but I laughed AT this one . Just too stupid to buy the plot . . . there is no suspension of belief . . . this movie just doesn't sell it . ; - (
20954|1|i hate this movie it is the worst thing to every hit the screen i would rather have my toe nails ripped out one by one than see that movie . i swear to god if i had the power to abolish this movie from time constrants i would . to be honest midevil torture would be mor pleassurefull than this god dam movie
20956|1|this was the dumbest movie i have ever seen
20967|1|It's amazing this insignificant , low-budget piece of crap garnered the following it did , seeing that it's one of the worst films ever puked out by Hollywood . Starring unctuous P . Swayze , a clubfooted hoofer in need of acting lessions and pinchfaced little trollop Jennifer Grey , nice body , honker and all . The best thing about this turkey is the fact that it takes place in the Borscht Belt , oy vey , which harkens back to childhood memories in my long-distant past . Even the dancing , the supposed strong suit of this attempt at making a movie , was predictable and hardly impressive . What would have made this a better movie is if Grey did about fifteen nude scenes : this would have kept me from nodding off every five minutes or so . Cousin Brucie Morrow's favorite flick , and that tells you plenty .
20968|1|I dislike dancing in general . I think if people want to go humiliate themselves , Go on ahead and do it ! The music isn't my style either .
21026|1|This movie sucked , and the music sucked . The gist of The Wall is we should all feel sorry for this rock star because he's tired of the rat race and his dad died in World War II . There are about a million other folks who are tired of the rat race and there are plenty of people who have lost their dads and they don't go out and make abysmal pulp like The Wall . Irishgit's assertion that this movie would be fine for a high school junior's film project is dead on .
21058|1|The movie was terribly inaccurate in it's potrayal of Jim . He had a very sweet , shy side which made him irristable to every one who knew him . I'm saddened that this generation is getting such a horrible depiction of Jim .
21077|1|if that guy was on my roof singing and dancing i would throw a chair at him
21086|1|A stupid , inconsequential musical based on the life of a totally unimportant dictator's wife , who was also totally unimportant in her own right . Useless premise supported by a typically wan , banal and limp score concocted by that dreadful A . L . Webber , the composer of some of worst crap ever heard by humankind . Add the most overrated no-talent since Bing Crosby / Bob Hope , namely Madonna , who can't sing , dance or act ( a triple threat ) and wooden , sleazy-looking Antonio Banderas , and you have the workings of a feature film whose entire contents should have been left on the cutting room floor . A friend of mine rented this video for a small social gathering , and we laughed and laughed at how atrociously bad this cultural afterbirth was . Who bankrolls crap like this ? And better yet , you actually coughs up the $ $ $ to actually go see this in a theatre ?
21087|1|Madonna was TOO old to play Eva Peron . No wonder Argentina was crying .
21096|1|it is so stupid .
21109|1|What was the point of this movie other than to cash in on Beatlemania ? No plot , weak soundtrack , and worst of all , John's silliness .
21118|1|'Godspell' is better , more faithful to the Bible .
21120|1|Bloody awful . One of the worst movies , musical or otherwise , I've ever seen . Would make the apostles think twice about their faith .
21131|1|theres no way a stupid preacher could control a town like that banning rock music and dancing in the 80's no in the 50's yes when there were so many corrupt towns and corruption yes but not in the 80's
21175|1|As far as I'm concerned , when the '60's / 70's ended , so did the appeal of this flakey film and play . Actually having a desire to sit through it now would be like suddenly getting an urge to wear bell bottoms , tie-dyed T shirt , wrap a rag around my head and go around giving the peace sign . It just isn't going to happen .
21180|1|It starred Elvis . No movie he starred in rates higher than a 1 .
21211|1|Oh Lord in his Heaven this is awful .
21233|1|I like parts of this record , but I was totally embarrassed for Pete Townshend and ( especially ) Roger Daltry when I finally saw a bit of this on TV .
21245|1|Silly B-movie .
21250|1|The real crime is that theme song ! KILLL IT !
21254|1|Since there are now two versions , my question is , was anyone really buying Glen Close in this role ? Meg Ryan is younger by a long shot and even SHE would be too old to play Nellie . If they were just trying to find work for older actresses , why not let Mitzi Gaynor reprise the role . Tsk , tsk . If you enjoy the story and music , stick with the much superior 1950's version .
21255|1|This is the South Pacific for the TV verion I was subjected to last week , not the Rodgers and Hammerstein original . First of all , badly acted , so why not thow in a bunch of swear words , THAT will make it good . 50 something Nellie ? Oh God . Throw in that HORRIBLE Blood Mary . . . lots of sex , oh thanks guys . Typical America . The girls who holds out get the guy and the girl who gives it up sits on the side of the road selling junk nobody wants . Thanks for that dose of reality . Thankfully sleep claimed me an hour and 45 minutes into the show or I may have had to look at that aweful selection for Joe Cable . Hmm . , Ameil was OK . The only cute about the entire movie was the two little kids . If Hollywood or whoever claims this remake can't think of new scripts they better get out there and find new writers .
21264|1|Why would any one make a sequal to SNF wasn't the first movies bad enough . Oh and to make it even better , Sly is directing what a mess . They should have call it Saturday Night fights and in the end Sly beats the hell out of John Travolta .
21265|1|The fourth-rate sequel of a third-rate film that featured a second-rate male lead . Add a fifth-rate director and a score by a sixth-rate musical act , and you've got the recipe for one of the worst motion pictures ever made . A stupendous waste of film stock .
21271|1|It's Elvis for gods sake . Nothing but a vehicle for him and others to make money . None of his movies featured any acting or even a defineable storyline worth mentioning . They are all one thing . . . Elvis singing . Wee . . .
21283|1|Stupid , vapid concept with a 25 cent script , lame acting , aimless direction , frenetic and visually unappealling dancing , and a score that sounds as dated as a Bee Gees record . They even used a body double for J . Beals' tushy scenes .
21310|1|Jennifer Lopez sucked back then as bad as she does now .
21311|1|Rightfully reguarded as one of the worst movies ever made . Not in the way that PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE is , just so bad , it is actually fun to watch , but in a way that is actually painfull to watch . Disappointing from the opening credits to the closing credits . I can't believe George Burns , who is usually a rather good comic , would have agreed to appear in this peice of trash . If you are a Beatles fan , despite the title , I urge you to skip this movie . I have not had any respect for Peter Frampton since seeing this dreck . It is hard to take him seriously anymore . The only redeaming quality about this abomanation is the beauty of the actress who played Strawberry Fields , even though she couldn't act her way out of a plastic bag . When I first heard about this movie I was very excited , being a huge fan of the Beatles . The cast sounds like it can't miss . But , someone , in the opening two minutes , I knew this film would be bad . I can't believe just how bad it was . As a comparison , this movie makes SHOWGIRLS seem like an Oscar winner . And SHOWGIRLS is one of biggest disappoints in movie history . Whenever SGT . PEPPER is scheduled to be shown on tv ( which is rare , thank god ! ! ! ! ! ) , I turn off my televison , lest I catch just a glimpse of this travesty . There are not enough words in the English language , or any other , to describe my hatered for this god-awful piece of crap .
21312|1|This movie is so bad , pointless and wastes a lot of talent , except for the Bee Gees who suck . This movie should have never been made , it is horrifficly bad . If you are any kind of Beatles fan do not see this movie . If you are not a Beatles fan do not see this movie . It is probably one of the worst movies ever made . The only redeaming thing about it is Aerosmiths Version of Come Together .
21315|1|Everyone connected with the making of this thing should be flogged .
21316|1|I would like to been there when they came up with the idea for this movie . Let's make a musical movie about The Beatles and not have The Beatles ! Then who will replace them ? The Bee Gees ! Great idea !
21334|1|Mariah as an actress ? ! You've got to be s * * * * * n' me ! ! !
21339|1|Mariah , you stick with SINGING and J-LO , you stick with ACTING .
21341|1|HA , HA , HA , Ha ! ! I didn't even have to see this movie to know it was one of the worst films ever created ! Mariah and talent do not bekong in the same sentence unless the word bad is also used . The story is obvious and has been run into the growned over a hundred times . Now it is miss Mariah's turn . Strange how she had a mental breakdown just days before her movie opened . Doesn't seem like an obvious desperate attempt to stur up contoversy and maybe temt some dim witted suckers into seeing a lame and dare i say cliched to the foulist depths of hell peice of poo cinema . If you have half a brain , do not waist your cash . THIS HAS BEEN A MESSAGE FROM THE ANTI - POP STARS TURN ACTOR / ACTRESS COMITEE . I support real actors and actress's in film .
21346|1|only saw a few minutes of this horrid movie . I am glad American Idol got wise . after this junk . a very sad kick back to the beach party movies from the 60s . Kelly at least managed to go on and have a career . As for Justin , where is he now ?
21347|1|first of all this movie sucks second this movie is gay these 2 lame rods from american idol can not act they can not sing this movie sucks the music sucks
21348|1|The title , and the stars of this film are reason enough to stay away .
21349|1|From Justin to Kelly to the toilet . The producers should be shot .
21353|1|[ just the sound of vomit ]
21355|1|pretty bad . Grease 2 never should have happened unfunny and dumb . Michelle P . did the best she could do with clunker . thankfully it did not stop her for going on to better movies .
21357|1|Other than the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer , there is nothing at all redeeming about this cheap film .
21358|1|As if the first one wasn't bad enough .
21382|1|lmao at star wars . star wars sucks
21386|1|Lame and dimwitted story line . B-Movie material with an A-list budget . Proof positive of the disminished capacity and ability of the American Cinema .
21406|1|the best of the 4 !
21443|1|star wars sucks
21446|1|very BAD ! ! ! !
21460|1|YOU CALL THIS MOVIE SCI-FI ? ? ? ? ?
21471|1|Really didn't like it
21482|1|Movie is too long and is boring .
 2149|1|There was no salvaging this shipwreck .
21491|1|soooo silly , sooooo cheesy , plus it looks sooooo dated now , but i will admit , the special effects are awsome , especially 4 it's time , but F / X does not compensate for a SILLY movie with grade Z acting .
21514|1|A snoozer .
21517|1|Total garbage . I tried as hard as I could to like this movie , but couldn't . Bad acting ( Natalie Portman was awful , as was Sam Jackson ) . The transformation to Vader wasn't believable- in a matter of minutes Anakin goes from good to ambivilent to child killer . Stupid . And Darth Vader walking like Frankenstien ? How about I've got the higher ground ? WTF ? Throughout the prequels people jump over each other in sword fights with no problem . My biggest complaint- the empire only existed for 18 years before a New Hope ? ? ? A New Hope made it sound like the Jedi were forgotten legends , not a goup that had only disappeared for two decades . Lame .
21541|1|I am sorry , I tried , I really did , but this movie is incredibly BORING . . . . drags on forever and ever .
21557|1|Needs Tom Bombadil ! ! ! !
21560|1|What a waste of time . I've never seen so many weird people in one movie theatre at once .
21568|1|First let me say that I have been reading Sci Fi and Fantasy for 35 years but this movie was BORING . . . it was WAY to long with to many bloated scenes
21608|1|Even worse than the book .
 2161|1|Long slow awful movie , dfficult to figure out on times , including That overweight Marlon Brando sweating and mumbling his way through a load of bollocks in a cave . . . .
21612|1|Not even stylish direction could save this tired mess of a movie epic . Quite boring and not enough substance to keep itself interesting or engaging .
21616|1|terrible
21705|1|Not the only one , Kristinand .
21707|1|i must be only one who reallly hates all Lord of the Rings movies
21740|1|boring
21786|1|This movie sucked and that's about all I have to say .
21787|1|The movie was pretty good . I'm only giving this movie a terrible rating , because I feel that it should be below The Matrix : Reloaded most definitely .
21802|1|I firmly believe that unless you have read the book and have some kind of background of the story , you won't like this movie much . It was frustrating to watch because I really wanted to enjoy it , but couldn't . . because I didn't know the characters , didn't understand what was going on , nor did I care .
 2181|1|Way too over the top , and boring for me . Special effects are very limited , as well as any good acting .
21817|1|Despite an excellent performance by Ian McKellan , the film is a waste of time , and offers nothing . McKellan is wasted with only 20 minutes screen time , and the entire movie is one big boxing match . There is not one interesting moment in this film .
21829|1|Nothing special . . . The movie sucks .
21837|1|This gets a one because it isnt out yet , and the annoying cultish Hobbit lovers have already started to rate it .
21908|1|I'LL BE BACK and it gets boring and boring , though it's pretty classic because of the classic arnold in uniform , at least I like the GNR soundtrack of it . watching it once would be enough .
21938|1|I think these are both really bad movies .
21952|1|Stupidest movie i have ever seen and it was soo cheesy and i fell asleep watching it . on funnyparts it was soooo dumb it was a waist of my time and i think that you should consider burrning that movie . AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !
 2198|1|How could they do this to Dumas ? Awful , awful adaptation . Read the book instead .
21988|1|This movie is one of the worst ever made , I know , I have seen almost all of the sci-fi movies made after 1980 , this movie has stiff acting , if you were riding on a roller coaster you'd fall asleep if you were watching this movie . I give it 2 thumbs way , way , down .
21995|1|had some funny moments , but overall , this movie isn , t holding up very well .
22004|1|This movie was terrible ! The book was so much better than the movie ! I would never reccomend this movie to anyone !
22089|1|A boring , tedius , pessimsitic sci-fi film that is terribly overrated , the Matrix combines objectionable content with a plot that creeps you out . Star Trek is the best sci-fi franchise out there , so watch the hundreds of hours of brilliant sci-fi than this boring movie .
22103|1|Drug addled nightmare .
22109|1|OK , I know there's a huge legion of fans . . . but this movie really sucks and Keanu Reeves too ( he's not an actor ) The good point is just for the FX .
22120|1|A too long videoclip devoid of any sense of humour , acting or cinematography . Someone went berserk with computer FX , but didn't get them right . I've seen computer games that had better graphics and textures . A lot of computer games , really . No plot to speak of , no script . NOT a movie ;
 2213|1|Well said , Genghis , in hindsight this movie did suck .
22170|1|Despite the film's complimentary reviews and it's growing legion of fans , it is terrible . A special effects extravaganza and not much more . A somewhat confusing plot , and long periods of unexciting storyline don't help this movie live up to it's comic book beginnings . Maybe it can all be summed up in two words : Keanu Reeves .
  222|1|Quite a waste of my time , the people's time , and the Academy Award voter's judgement . Granted , an epic film is a very tough task to undertake , but Mel Gibson falters on every level here , plummeting a beautiful story into little more than something to throw popcorn at . His acting was ridiculous and overdone , and while the scenery ( but not atmosphere ) was visually pleasing , he give the viewer no chance to bask in it the way he should . The drama here is all false .
 2223|1|I don't like it one bit . Except the fact Tom Cruise is in it . Otherwise its just a stupid , broing movie that just talks and talks .
 2226|1|Puerile and obvious beyond belief , not to mention jingoistic . A disgusting movie . I wanted to take a shower after watching ten minutes of it .
 2227|1|Rent the film Sleep With Me . In it Quentin Terrentino explains why this is the gayest movie ever made . You'll never watch it the same way again .
22336|1|The first time I watched it I almost fell asleep .
22337|1|Dreadfully dull , alternating with smarmy .
22362|1|Overrated as a sci-fi film . Basically a B-horror movie in outer space . Star Trek is an infintely better sci-fi franchise .
22371|1|Completly unoriginal . Contains you're basic components for a scary movie . Ripoff of an even older sci-fi movie .
22388|1|Alien is one of the worst movies ever made .
22389|1|Should have been called " Conan the Annoyer . "
22390|1|Terrible sequel to the much better 1979 film . The only things that aren't so bad about it are seeing Wilt in barbarian gear and the Asian guy , the shaman who hangs out with Conan : his real name is Mako , with the incredibly cool voice . It's awful otherwise
22396|1|The movie should be destroyed along with Conan . . . . . .
22400|1|I thought the first episode was bad , but this one is so much worse . The one good thing about this one is that we see very little of Jar Jar . Anakin is a whole lot older now and start becoming a bit rebellious . I'm sorry but Hayden Christiansen just doesn't seem like the right person to do the job . I thought his acting was horrible - he seemed to be about as competent as a 7th grader putting on a middle school play . The storyline was pathetic if you ask me . Everything happens way too fast , it's as if nothing develops . Jango Fett's involvement in this movie seems unecessary to me as well . There's a lot of action but aside from Yoda's lightsaber scene , none of it was nearly as good as it could've been . The Clone Wars is a really cool concept that could've made a great movie , but as with the Phantom Menace , Lucas really mucked it up .
22408|1|I have seen vacation videos that are more interesting than this .
22415|1|The nifty special effects could not save the horrendous acting . George Lucas has finally lost his mind . There was no good performance . Even Christopher Lee couldn't deliver the join the dark side speech in a way that didn't sound exactly like the first one from Vader . The crowning achievement in this horrible travesty of a film was Skywalker Sr . goes to rescue his mother . I literally was crying with laughter when she looked up into her son's eyes , just barely holding onto life , and says Ani ? Is that you ? Oh , you're so handsome . What is this ? A visit to Grandma's ? Just a perfectly awful film . The only parts I enjoyed were the parts when there was no dialogue to ruin it .
22461|1|The best of the Star Trek movies . The rest don't even deserve one star . When I saw this I kept waiting for Tattoo to run in yelling Boss , Boss , ze starship , ze starship .
22481|1|Trekkies * shudder *
22482|1|I'm not a Star Trek fan at all and I'm not quite sure why I actually saw this movie . I thought it was horrible . I kept waiting for Herve Villecheve to come out and give Mr . Rork a hand .
22537|1|Another Tim Burton mess . The thing that amazes me about all the recent Batman movies is that the main character is the villain . In this case the Joker played by Jack ! The movie is so dark and the casting of Michael Keaton still boggles the mind . I found it to be very disappointing .
22540|1|Holy Hollywood Hell ! I love Tim Burton's work when it suits his mindset , but this was all wrong . And Michael Keaton ! Like casting John Wayne as Attila the Hun . And will somebody shoot Robert Wuhl , please ?
22577|1|i remember going to see this the very first day it came out and it was a big dissapointment . it would have been alot better if james cameron would have directed it and if edward furlong was in it .
22585|1|I really wasn't impressed with this . . Ok , fantastically done action scenes with amazing special effects . And that is it really . You can tell this film is centered around Arnie and it really doesn't pay off . The script was bitty and this film was no-where near as thought provoking as the previous two . A massive disappointment .
22591|1|t3 was a joke . Did they writers even watch the first two movies ? ? They butchered the storyline , and ruined the trilogy . The previous movies were serious , with some comedy . . . this was a comedy with bad graphics . Graphics are suppose to make things LOOK more real , not totally abstract . ( see T2 idiots ) I think T2 graphics were much better . . . . and the sound . . . . bad sound . . . . what happened to NO FATE BUT WHAT WE MAKE . . . . the future isn't written ? ? ? ? then why the hell does J Conner have a solemate . What a joke . This isn't another stupid chosen one movie , where the he is destined to glory , he just happens to be the one who saves the day in the end . He isn't a jesus figure . . . . writters took stuff from the Matrix storyline and thrusted it into a much more complex story . T1 and T2 had a story , a good story , with significant action scenes and a plot . YES , PLOT . The amount of crap that was shoved into T3 complicated the movie , I don't even know exactly what happened . People don't need none stop action , T2 fans liked the story , not just effects . AND , the effects were actually good , not a joke . I still don't know how SKYNET was built despite the work of Dyson In short , T3 was a comedy , with no story , no acting , no sound , and no legitimate connection to the previous movies . I have so much respect for James Cameron that I never knew .
22606|1|Even the most fascinating , most excellent special effects can't save this flop based on the hit comic book series .
22616|1|X-Men was more of a movie for kids . It's a movie that has no point . The ending makes no sense and resolves nothing . X-Men is a cartoon that should remain a cartoon .
22629|1|X-Men seemes like a promising movie . My favorite Wolverine failed to meet the standard . Special effects were pretty cool but overall the story didn't go anywhere . Action is low and the plot is an absolute disaster .
22797|1|Bite my shiney metal arse .
22803|1|Annoying trash , with possibly the worst assembly of child actors in history . The fact that it slavishly follows the book is no plus in my view .
22805|1|How long can a movie be , and still feel like something was missing . The editing was horrible . The scene cuts were like somebody bumping the needle on a record player . Ouch ! But my kids loved it .
22806|1|Complete and total bull sh * t .
22807|1|The problem with humanity !
22810|1|eat my shorts .
22816|1|So stupid !
22823|1|Ummmmm . . . . . . sucks the big one .
22898|1|One of the most boring sci-fi movies I have ever sat and squirmed through . The encounter was just too close and stifling for me to repeat .
22920|1|I mean honestly , KUBRICK is not that good at all . He has always been overrated , and especially this particular movie of his . It sucked real bad , and this is honestly one of those times when I can say the word suck , and that is exactly what this movie did . . it was just horrendous in every way . It started out wierd , and ended wierd . Most people would be confused by this whole atrocity , so I don't recommend it to anyone . It is the beginning of many bad movies by this director . . . .
22923|1|Like all Kubrick films , this movie is completely useless .
22938|1|Terrible Terrible , o se habla Espa ol , Terrible . What kind of a name for a movie is that , Clockwork Orange . If I went to a movie theater watching this movie , I'd have to wear a paper bag over my head . Nothing about this movie was interesting . I fell asleep , even though the theater was playing in surround sound .
22957|1|Predictable , badly filmed , and Charleton Heston's acting is so bad it would knock a hound-dog off a gut wagon .
22979|1|Confusing , irritating , absolutely no plot at all and annoying music . 90 % of the time it was just abstract pictures and special effects with absolutely no meaning . The few interactions between the characters were boring and I still think they were the least worst parts of the movie . My sister went shopping right after the movie had begun and when she returned 2 hours later she asked me why it was still in the same place as when she left . To sum it up : There are surely better things to do with your time . Not even worth renting . People only praise it because they think it makes them look intellectual .
22988|1|An appalling film ! May possibly have a strange appeal to pseudo-intellectual types , but has no soul . Sorry !
23011|1|crap , really crap . . . the beginning seemed good but then . . . . went down down down
23065|1|I would've been really depressed after seeing this movie if I actually cared . Probably someone born after 1985 might think this is high art , since crappy movies were the norm by then , but thinking it don't make it so . Lucas should give the money back for this one . Did noone see the stark resemblance in plot to the first movie ? I'm supposed to believe a 6-year old can fight in a space battle ? You mean Darth Vader grown up and chasing Luke down the Death Star trench doesn't have a flash of deja vu and say , hmm . . maybe I'm not gonna win this after all . . . this reminds me of when I was a kid . . . Darth Maul came and went , but Jar Jar wouldn't go away . I couldn't make heads or tails out of the murky political subplot . It sucked even more than Howard the Duck
23066|1|What the hell happened ? George takes 15 years off from the saga and loses all touch with the original concept . Where is this going ? Even after seeing Clones , I still don't know why he's taking this route . I think * I * could write it better .
23067|1|Sucked . This movie completly ruined the franchise . Darth Maul was the only cool character and they killed him off . What were they thinking ?
23082|1|Never have I been so disappointed in anything in my entire life . George Lucas robbed me of my sense of adventure in trade for some petty computer-generated special effects . When I watch or even think about the original trilogy I feel empty inside . Thanks George .
23085|1|Star Wars : The Phantom Meanace is the first of the new trilogy that George Lucas has come out with . It is in fact a badly made film with annoying characters and no plot or storyline whatsoever . The acting was terrible , and you can't ask an 8-year old boy to take the role of a role that a 30-year old man took 25 years ago .
23112|1|With Star Wars , George Lucas turned the film industry on its head . With Phantom Menace , George Lucas joined the rest of the film industry in its superficial marketing-fest . Phantom Menace does not have the uncorrupted feel of ( the original 1977 version of ) Star Wars . Episode I takes itself far too seriously . It has no wit , no great chemistry between the stars , and hardly any character development . The actors do very little to create sympathy . All that and barely enough plot to fill a midichlorian's left nostril . But what about all the great inside jokes ? I hear you whine . What about them ? If I want a bunch of gratuitous inside jokes , I'll watch the latest Disney movie .
23119|1|Phantom Menace is vacuous technical wizardry .
23164|1|This movie sucks . Christopher Lambert is not a good actor and Sean Connery must have been needing some quick cash to star in this junk . I know this has a huge following , but I'm still trying to figure out why .
23215|1|Dont make em like this anymore . . . . .
23219|1|Some how they managed to make a more uninteresting movie than the first , amazing ! How anyone could enjoy this bothers the hell out of me , nothing personal though , to each his own , but I really hate Harry Pothead because the movie felt like a bad acid trip . And to Piper Norman : Yes , yes he is .
23222|1|Grow up !
23226|1|As if the first one wasn't bad enough . The only redeeming feature here was Branagh's performance , although even that isn't enough to award another star .
 2323|1|A pure mess , by a horrible director . Unfortunately the director once again brought down a bunch of great talent . . . too bad . . .
23234|1|This movie was okay , but should be further down on the list .
23236|1|crap
23239|1|Horrible , thats all i have to say .
 2326|1|One of the biggest disappoints I have ever seen . Just another cheep rehash of a tired plot , with stupid and predictable lines .
23276|1|Unnecessary use of special effects on Jodie Foster's teeth during her 'endeavor' , she doesn't need to look any scarier than she already is .
23283|1|Horrible ! I expected more alien contact . The movie dragged on and on and on and on and . . . .
 2329|1|Got to be one of the all time terrible movies ever made . . . . . .
23296|1|Not fit to hold Wrath of Khan's jockstrap . The only reason this movie ( or any of the later movies , especially the old Trek / TNG crossovers ) succeed is that there is a nation of pasty , maladjusted Trekkies out there sustaining that industry from the comfort of their parents' basements . I like Trek too , especially because it is such a deeply detailed subject , but these movies are just pander .
23304|1|I think this movie was soooo boring . I fell asleep during the first ten minutes of the movie . Me and my friend only rented that movie because we saw everything else already .
23311|1|FAKE !
23315|1|Never seen anything so stupid in all my life ! ! ! ! ! !
23320|1|I'd have been happier if they stayed away from my home .
 2333|1|Anyone who thinks Brendan Fraser is funny needs a lobotomy .
23330|1|too old
23352|1|Why would you want to make a movie out of a terrible series ? ? ? They already tried Lost In Space , and we saw how bad that turned out . The X-Files Movie , is about 2 secret agents who are on a fight to save the future . . . duh ?
23382|1|Poorly written , directed , and acted . Jim Carrey turned in the usual horrible manic performance , the female lead was equally bad . And the plot was idiotic . Easily the worst movie of the year to date .
23385|1|From the trailers and reviews , one gets the impression that this one of those moronic angst-ridden pseudo-art films . BORING !
23395|1|The Abyss is where this mess belongs .
 2340|1|You know what ? Hollywood won't stop making these movies until we stop watching them . You will continue to see terrible special effects and even worse acting until we stop wasting our money . The Mummy is one of the many perfect examples of worthlessness that are being tossed in our direction . For the love of God don't watch this movie .
23417|1|Really butt awful . Think of all the hungry poor people we could've fed with the money they spent on this turkey .
23420|1|This is quite simply one of the worst movies of all time . The plot is not well contrived , nor the story set properly . The characters and scenes are very surrealistic , almost to the point of existentialism , and the humorous portions of the film are rather transparent . The story is very predictable , and the special effects , mediocre . I cannot recommend this movie to anyone , and while Chris Tucker was funny , he was also tedious and unnecessary . Additionally , the love story was thin , and under developed while Gary Oldman was just stupid : so much so , that I believe his performance in Lost in Space was better than this one .
23436|1|The plot has no cohesion at all- it meanders through an eternity of disjointed situations . Special effects and bizarre sensationalism are not enough to hold my interest without a plot .
23447|1|It is a cheap , unorignal remake of a cheap , unorignal movie called WAR OF THE WORLDS . The acting was poor . The plotline totaly unrealistic and the ending to pat and easy . Nothing scary or surprising about this one .
23448|1|Like all Shamalyan films , boring , poorly-acted and shameful .
23450|1|THIS MOVIE WAS NOT SCARRY AT ALL , IT WAS BORING . AND IT SUCKED , A LOT OF MY FRIENDS TOLD THAT WAS A SCARRY MOVIE . [ NOT TRUE ] IM GIVING THIS ONE STAR .
23454|1|I was expecting the movie to be alot better than this . It sucked big time , I didn't get it .
23456|1|That movie was so BORING ! There was only one scary part in the whole film . The part when the alien thingy walked out from behind the bushes . I laughed at most of it like the part where they had tin foil on their heads .
23462|1|Okay , I'm sorry to say this , but I hated this movie . ALL of the characters have exactly one facial expression - disturbed . Aside from that , this would have been a much better story if they had left the whole alien thing a mystery , but to actually bring them out and cut off their fingers . . . Well , they lost me there .
23483|1|I don't understand how any postpubescent human being could think the premise of this show is interesting or reasonable in the least . Intellectually ( almost comically ) puerile , this is comic book material for teenagers .
 2350|1|WAY too conufusing , not enough action .
23520|1|i won't let averages play a role in being a better movie . This one was terrible ! ! ! ! !
23542|1|I think the movie is not as good as it is advertised on tv or radio . The comics and the series on tv were great but the movie is s * * * . * * * DESTROY EVERYTHING * * *
23581|1|The single worst movie made about the Arthurian legends . Nice shiny armour though .
23583|1|The glossiest armor in the middle ages couldn't hide the dimness of this movie , but lord knows they tried .
23602|1|I've decided that the incredibly positive reviews of Minority Report are the result of The Emperor's New Clothes phenomenon . That's the only way I can explain how such a HORRIBLE movie could receive accolades across the board . Here are my major complaints : 1 . The plot was flimsy and even ridiculous in many spots . 2 . There was almost no character development . 3 . The special effects were ludicrous and inconsistent . 4 . The acting was a terrible . 5 . The movie was FAR too long , and the ending was laughable . There are many other problems with the movie , but I don't have two more hours to record them all in my comment . All I can say is avoid this movie at all costs !
23619|1|I have never been sodimized with a broomstick and thanks to Dark City , there was no messy clean up . This movie is some 18 years old bathroom fantasy where the reality of life is changed by creepy aliens wearing dead bodies . The only scary thing about this movie is the realization that you are now 1 hour closer to death because you wasted your time .
23622|1|This movie was horrible . I needed a flashlight to watch this thing the lighting was so bad . The acting was horrible . Kiefer Sutherland had the most annoying voice .
23636|1|More like Matrix regurgitated , this movie reeks .
23639|1|Utter garbage . Pseudo philosophy that wouldn't fool an intelligent junior high-school student . Apparently there aren't to many of those rating it here .
23645|1|both movie and video game sucked
23656|1|FAR TOO MUCH TALKING . ABSOLUTE CRAP
23661|1|The first one was good , and instead of sticking with what made it good , the brothers put out a big steaming pile of crap
23668|1|I couldn't believe how bad this movie stunk . I would have rather spent my money on seeing X2 again .
 2368|1|This was terrible . They completely destroyed any resemblance this movie might have had to the original TV Series , which was fantastic .
23680|1|One dozen too many apes .
23686|1|This was one of the worst movies I have ever witnessed ! How can it be rated so high ?
23689|1|Lame , flat rip-off of Aliens and other much better bug-eyed monster flicks , and a complete waste of an intriguing concept -- monsters in the darkness , in the most literal sense .
23721|1|I loved the first movie , but this movie . . . oh , man , they could have done so much with this , but it seems they chose not to ! In the first movie , they handled the CG and special effects beautifully , but in this one , it seemed they slacked off quite a bit ( not that I can do better , but that Scorpion at the end was mind-numbingly HORRIBLE ! ) . And the zepplin . . . oh , that was a bad idea . And , since sais originate from the 1600's in Okinawa as a farming tool , it's kind of hard to accept that ancient Egypt possessed these things as weapons back then ! Doing the face-in-the-sand thing in the first movie was kinda cool . Doing the face-in-the-water thing in this one was repetative . And , for the Rock fans--he's only in it for all of maybe two minutes , one of which is spent in a horrible CG replication of him . You'd be better off seeing Scorpion King if you want to see him . Altogether , if you want to watch it , by all means do so . . . just know that you've been warned !
23737|1|This movie was so cliched and predictable that i found myself crying and laughing with insanity at the same time from the stupidity
23750|1|A textbook example of how to make a bad movie out of a good book .
23753|1|It was so predictable that I fell asleep- at the movies , and I never do that : )
23770|1|Thank God those aliens had windows '95 are we were all screwed . Why revive the first lady twice just to kill her off in an anti-climactic scene ? Why was Bill Pullman doing a bad Eastwood impression ? Why was Judd Hirsch doing an even worse Jackie Mason ? Why did the annoying guy from the Big Chill save the earth ( Goldblum doing a dead on but dreadful impression of himself from that movie ) ? How can Will Smith drag an alien from Colorado to Utah and back to Nevada in one afternoon ? Why did it take a hundred machine guns to kill that alien when Will knocked him out with one punch for two days last time ? What was the point of teasing the Harry Conick , Jr . character without developing him enough that we should care that he died ? Why are brain dead moviegoers so easily manipulated by things that go boom that they don't notice plot holes ? Because it had a big budget and an all star cast I declare this movie as THE WORST WASTE OF CELLULOID IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD ! ! ! !
23778|1|I will never understand why this movie made so much money . The only rational explanation I can think of is that Americans ( and the foreign audience too ) wanted to see the White House blown up . . . sad , sad state of affairs , when this movie is a box office smash .
23782|1|Terrible , horrible , disgusting . It's a pity to see how the money is spent on this way .
23783|1|This movie was bad
 2379|1|I walked out on it . I guess I'm just not into Jodie Foster's latest movies .
23791|1|Right down there with Battlefield Earth . This is a terrible movie and I've written numerous reviews on it . . . I won't get into it now - there's simply too much to talk about . I'm surprised that so many people can't see how stupid this movie is .
23804|1|hahahahahaahahaahah !
23805|1|Why anyone wants to discover this crap is beyond me .
23815|1|I saw this movie in the theater and it really stinks . My suit for my money back is still pending !
23817|1|Just awful . Stupid . Jack Nicholson's worst movie .
23820|1|Absolutely wretched . I'll admit that I watched it once out of sheer curiousity and was amazed at the utter stupidity . Nicholson and Close are wasted here .
23850|1|One of the only films where I walked out of the theatre within half an hour .
23852|1|I have seen better flops from a fish on a river bank . . .
23861|1|A dark , pessimsitic , profanity-laced time travel tale . Star Trek time-travel adventures are millions of times better !
 2387|1|I'm sorry to say but I really hated this movie . It was predictible , annoying and not thrilling at all . The directing was the worst thing about this movie . This movie is a waste of time !
23873|1|A yucky movie based on a bad video game series . Give me Mario or Poke'mon instead .
23899|1|If you are going to tell one of histories greatest storys don't mess with it . Achilies never sees the inside of Troy as he is shot in the heal . It one of the the biggest parts of Homer's story but Hollywood comes along and change a major part . The effects were nice but the acting was not that great and neither was the script .
23916|1|this was a piece of f * * * * c * * * it was a sh * * movie
23933|1|One of the worst Hollywood propaganda movies about global warming . You don't like global warming ? Fine , make a movie better than this ! They run from the cold in this awful excuse of a movie . The cold actually stay out . Randy Quaid actuallly sacrifices a useful man to save a son that may , or may not , be alive . He actually finds him , and when he knocks on the door , they get looks on their faces as if the cold decided to try to get them again . Sela Ward stays with a child when no one in their right mind would . People actually freeze instantly . People try to get to safety after they discover the flood waters have frozen . It's odd that Sela , Jake , and Randy all survive in this awful movie . The main family always survives in a disaster movie of this magnitude . I will say this : The scenes involving the three guys monitoring buoys of the coast were great . I wish they were in this movie more .
23937|1|As a Geo-science major in college -- I have to say this movie breaks all rules of geophysics --- and really just basically sucks . What a joke -- especially the insta-freeze of solid objects like buildings . Another Hollywood POS offering .
23938|1|Really dumb movie . It seemed like a movie made by the green party to convince us to stop driving cars or this will happen to us . It's totally ridiculous . The whole United States was destroyed but they were saved by moving to Mexico . Not only is the script reallly dumb but the special effect weren't impressive either . Hardly watchable .
23954|1|The sad part was , they found the bastard .
23962|1|I was ready to start an insurrection when I saw it . And that was just on video .
23965|1|Why is this so high on the list ? ! ! -- I'll fix that . People , this is part of the Really Bad Existentialist Trilogy ( with 1 5 ) . The fountain of youth planet does not a good and believable plot make . This plays like an overlong episode of the series , and indeed , essentially rips off some of the same plots from The Next Gen series . All the attempts at humor are flat , stupid , and downright embarrassing , and all the regulars seem ashamed to be in this movie . There are some good parts here and there , but as a whole , it desperately needed a lot of work .
23969|1|This is one of the worst Star Trek movies yet . It features terrible acting , little / no storyline , and also no accuracy within the Star Trek world . Unfortunately , this movie could be made by monkeys without typewriters .
23978|1|This movie is like having extensive dental work . You are very relieved when its over .
23988|1|Steven Spielberg missed the mark . Stanley Kubrick missed the mark . How many must ? This film is bad . A modern day retelling of Pinoccio , this film leaves much to be desired . It is not lack of good effects , or dialog . I was just board . The film was not anything like what I had expected , and I felt it was a mockery of what might be . The entire film has a wholly surrealistic quality which I found very bothersome , and the end is anticlimactic with a major let down .
23991|1|WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP ? ? ? ? ?
23992|1|Very weak flick . Spielberg successfully captured every cliche you can think about from previous science fiction stories . The entire movie is one big Hey , I saw that in another movie .
23995|1|A jacked up version of the Good Son . Think about the similarities . Both movies have the biggest name child actor of the day , who usually plays nice sweet roles , playing a twisted kid . They turn against the other child and fight for the mother's love . This movie was overwhelmingly boring , the last 20 minutes were probably the most meaningless moments of my life . I think that is what hell is like , you are forced to watch clips of movies that are long and boring and have no purpose . The only reason I went to see this movie is because my girlfriend's cousin , Jake Thomas , plays the human son . Even her family thought the movie was slow and stupid . I think it was well marketed , because if you remember the trailers basically left everything up to the imagination . Everybody assumed that Spielberg and Osmet would team up for a masterpiece , but it turned out to be a disaster .
24011|1|I think this movie ( like Eyes Wide Shut ) is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes with those desperate to accepted , by the psuedo-intellectual Wanna-Bee's repeating ridiculous comments ; Wonderous , Brilliant , etc . BLECHHHH ! ! ! ! ! This film was TOO long and boring , there was no point to it . No story , the kid / robot was extremely creepy and I would have had him destroyed . The real kid was dying of a virus and is up and around within ten minutes ? ! ? ! The husband brought the thing home and then hates it ? ! ? ! None of it made any sense . Alien / Robots ? ! A Fairy Statue that after two thousand years looks to have been painted that day ? ! In fact , the entire movie was stupid and our opinion of Mr . Spielberg has dropped considerably . Definitely the WORST Movie That Spielberg has EVER been associated with . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ! ! ! !
24042|1|This was a childish attempt at a movie . The plot was shallower and more cliche riddled than any movie every made . The graphics were not good as everyone claims , and definitely do not add to this piece of garbage . The movie is a bust and justly so is the joke of a company that made this .
24044|1|Video Games should never be made into movies . Look at Super Mario Brothers .
24053|1|Drug induced .
24054|1|Saw this as a kid and didn't understand any of it . Now i'm grown i understand it but it hasn't improved any .
24067|1|Completely boring . Kirk talks to a computer . Haven't I heard that before ? Too similiar to the plot used throughout the series .
24068|1|DULL
24082|1|It works . It works because DareDevil , much like Ben Afflick , is the worst in his trade . Crappy story + crappy actor = crappy film
24091|1|Ben Affleck is the worst actor ever .
24093|1|The lone star is for Jenny and her hot everything . I'd rather see the AFLAC goose star in a movie than that Affleck . Ben , acting , not your thing .
24104|1|Simple minded movie , made by simpletons . The portrayal of Chaucer is particularly ludicrous .
24120|1|Boring garbage . Not even laughable .
24121|1|The best thing about this movie is that it was mentioned in an episode of The Simpsons .
24152|1|Boring !
24159|1|I didn't find this movie to be interesting at all . It's just absolutely ridiculous . It makes you think about what you'd do if a huge meteor were about to kill everyone on the planet , but that's all it's good for . It's not entertaining , it's just stupid as the course of action the world leaders take to attempt to save the earth is about as logical as letting a Satanist give a sermon on Easter Sunday .
24170|1|Jeez I hate Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer . The sappiness and cornyness was spewing out my ears when I left the theater . They try to hard to keep a PG-13 rating , which makes them absolute phonies . The Horror . . . The Horror . . .
24174|1|Awful , cheesy , cheap sets that are reminiscent of 50's era B-grade sci-fi ; emotionally manipulative storyline with little depth ; unbelieveable scenarios that are supposed to make us cheer the good guys , but instead , make us wonder what were they thinking ? and finally , a favorly canned ending . Another USA saves the world movie ala Independence Day !
24179|1|What a dumb movie ! Another piece of bad entertainment from Jerry Bruckheimer . This film is loud , dumb , and full of special effects ; no one with half a brain would believe the plot of sending oil drills into space to blow up an asteroid . Filled with cliche's too , from the quirky comic relief characters to the self-sacrifice of Bruce Willis at the end . A poor excuse to show an expensive CGI scene of Paris blowing up .
24190|1|I rated Armageddon a 1 b / c it is a heavily hyped movie w / no plot , no good acting and a sick technology will save us-America can do anything metality !
24192|1|Tedious . Plodding . Infinitely dull . A waste of a fine comedic talent .
24206|1|Boy would I like to see Robin Williams play , oh , say , a cannibalistic pedophile , who's executed at the end of the movie . His cloying , bloodless portrayals of 'heartwarming' characters makes me want to puke .
24216|1|Awful ! Terrible , angst-ridden nonsense !
24217|1|hey Ang , I thought it was three strikes and your out , you must have your lips on the right asses . . .
24229|1|This was an AWFUL film it went on for WAY TO LONG and there were way to many science bits blabering on about nothing and how did the hulk lose all his clothes except his pants ?
24230|1|3 fight scenes ? I am sorely disappointed in Ang Lee . The fight scenes were perfect , but too few . Story really lacked considering more than three quarters of the movie focuses on it .
24243|1|I hated the fantastic four movie it had mostly lame characters . For example the Invisible Woman was such and bitch I mean she dumped a awesome guy just because she couldn't get her way . The Thing was so lame I mean you look like a rock get over it ! And Oh pleez the Human Torch was an @ $ $ hole with No personality , he was a total bastard . And on the comercials they made him out to be the coolest character ever but he SUCKED ! ! ! The only character that I liked honestly was Mr . Fantastic he was the only likeable character and they didn't even want to put as much focus on him as the Thing or the Torch .
24245|1|I give this movie one fantastic star . it sucked .
24260|1|Angelina Jolie STILL sucks .
24262|1|Sucks , it is poorly written . The only reason to see it is Angelina Jolie .
24269|1|When Trinity is dying . Neo : No Trinity ! You can't die ! Trinity : Yes I can . LAME Neo vs Smith Dragonball Z fight . SUCKED The first one is a classic , the second one was ok , this one blows goats .
24272|1|I'm so very disappointed ! I mean I was a major Matix Fan . Both of the first two movies were so good what was the chances they would totally bomb on the last one . I'm sorry but the movie was terrible ! What director kills the hero and the main character ! Maybe a director from foregin films but nobody else is that stupid .
24274|1|Huh ? What in the whole of hell was this movie about ? What are ANY of the MATRIX movies about ?
24284|1|This movie was lame . The whole train station scene was retarded . The french guy got punked out way to easy . Neo fights like a sissy in the real world . Then we're forced to watch morphus and the crew fly a ship for 2 hrs as the lamer characters defend club zion . The final fight was a Dragon Ball Z rip off and the ending sucked big time . They didn't even explain anything it just ended with the old bag and the architect ( aka Colonel Sanders ) talking at the park . WTF ? O yeah Trinity dies and so does Neo . How do you like them apples ?
24286|1|Fell asleep . It was like watching someone else play a video game
24288|1|My opinion , to like this movie , you have to take the blue pill . Revolutions is better then Reloaded . That sets the bar at about ground-- level . With ROCKY II , Aliens , Terminator 2 , God Father II , as examples of sequels worthy of the originals ; lets reset the bar . Pretend Revolutions directly follows The Matrix . Now do some Keanu math : High expectations [ ( Empty digital spectacle + meaningless characters ) gutted original characters ] x Stupefying Wizard of Oz plot turns = REVOLUTION IS BOGUS DUDE ! !
24295|1|The first movie I give a - 5 The second movie I give a - 3 If you want to see a movie with a good plot go see Kill Bill . See I understood everything the movie was saying but it was so stupit
24303|1|Well , plot has never exactly been a strength with this series . The special effects were decent , but the plot was totally ludicrous , and the acting was bad , too . There's 2 sequences you can laugh at though . One is on the plane there , where Sam Neill dreams that a raptor is talking to him . A second is when they find the cellphone in a huge pile of dinosaur turds , and suddenly a ceratosaur runs up and JUST looks at them before ambling off . Otherwise , it's awful .
24321|1|Movie was absolutely forgetable . The typical useless action drivel that dominates the movie scene these days . One of the worst movies of the year .
24322|1|What really burns me about this flick is that Martha sent me to Wal-Mart to buy some doo-dad she read in some insert ad in the paper . Now she knew about my " never again to Wal-Mart " vow , but quite frankly , Scarlett , she didn't give a damn ! But I digress . I walked by the bargain DVD bin and lo and behold here was " League of Extraordinary Gentlemen " for $ 4 . 99 . The price and the bin should have tipped me off , but NOOOO ! I BOUGHT IT . IT REALLY STINKS ! I could have had two pale ales on tap for what I sank into this trash !
24332|1|This is possibly the worst movie of 2003 . . . even the alleged great talent of Sean Connery couldn't save it . . . a complete bomb that isn't even worth watching if someone gave it to you free . . .
24343|1|Why don't they both die . No more 80s reminents .
24347|1|What a waste of two of the best monsters in recent cinematic history . The guy who made this couldn't direct traffic .
24353|1|. . . as if the first two weren't enough .
24367|1|What is this movie about ? It seems like they came up with stupid plot twists , to explain other stupid plot twists .
24375|1|Amittyville meets 2001 . Really a nifty idea . Too bad it failed miserably . Beyond the flashy and cool visual effect lies an incredibly poorly written and badly put together peice of sci-fi rubish . A great premise is waisted on cute and cliche teeny bop horror ploys that are so predictable even an unbore fetus could detect them . This film does however in the early moments give off a very creepy undertone . It keeps you hooked to the movie in hope throughout all the crap something genuinly scary and original will pop out and blow you away which unfortunatly never comes . Very disapointing and worth missing . Cool music though .
24378|1|A shallow plot with an unrealistic backstory . I am sorry but I have to rate this movie as terrible . I expected this movie to be better but sadly I was dissapointed . Essencially , all that happened was everyone went insane and killed each other . It's called acid guys , try it some time .
24382|1|Don't waste your time . . . this is a really bad movie .
24388|1|Absolutely a brain-dead movie . . . . who wrote this thing ? . . . . get out the tar and feathers .
24396|1|Senseless garbage . Poorly written and poorly put together . Not funny in the least bit .
24397|1|Ignorant , implausible even by sci-fi movie standards . Duchovney proves that he couldn't perform calisthenics , much less as an actor .
24402|1|Tasteless , boring , and unfunny parody on sci-fi films . Moore proves to be the only one strong to do anything with this film , because everyone else seems worn out and gives off no energy to be noticed .
24429|1|This movie cannot be helped . The thin plot and poorly crafted sets are only the beginning . Gary Busey doesn't portray someone with any depth , and while Russel tries to properly portray his character , the supporting roles and his scenes are without merit . The story is undeveloped , as are the characters , and the plot goes nowhere . This film's special effects are definitly below average , and the film's low budget shows through in every scene . I would ask Kurt Russell if he read the script before making this , or if they just through a good heap of money at him . This is even beneath his abilities as an actor .
24452|1|For the love of God , DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP !
24457|1|Why ? WHY ?
24476|1|boring movie
24478|1|I'm sure ripping off 2001 and Mission to Mars was no easy task , but these people did it . . . and wasted their time because this movie sucked . 2001 was an excellent movie and Mission was only half as bad . Combining them was a travesty and , I hope , career wrecking .
24488|1|More Will Smith drivel .
24493|1|that's nonsense
24494|1|Loses what little charm the first movie in the series had .
24503|1|It's just the same as the first one .
24509|1|A disgusting , incomprehensible piece of codswallop . Not fit for reptiles , even though the star is a reptile ( or something like one anyway )
24515|1|Basically we have " The Exorcist " meets " Rosemary's Baby " . If you enjoy special effects at the expense of character development and plot , by all means - indulge yourself . Personally , I found this about as interesting as a trip through a meat packing plant on a golf cart going 120 miles per as I'm paging through a comic book of the Gospels according to the mentally deranged . But , I won't go there since there isn't enough space on this page to cover the pathetic use and abuse of theology . I'll just sum up by saying ; not funny , not frightening - just near sited , ill informed and very , very dumb . I'll hand it to Reeves though ; he apparently stays on top of the acting game just enough to get first choice at the high budget glitz - wherein his only requirement is to storm around like a male model with an inflamed hemorrhoid spouting what might pass as witty one liners - provided you are still in high school . It would appear that the formula is ; throw in enough special effects as camouflage and anyone can look like an actor . Sadly , and for reasons I can no longer remember , I gave him a bit more credit than that . Up until now .
24519|1|I want 90 minutes of my life back . . .
24520|1|Come on now ! Puuuuleeeze !
24525|1|I only watched the first half hour- was forced to turn it off for being so bad . It has too many holes , the action is stupid , its unrealistic , and the camera motion is bad . Too often the camera is just a black picture where you can't even see anything . Stay away .
24536|1|Please don't waste your time and money on this Hollywood piece of junk . Aside from 'Battelfield Earth' , 'Mission to Mars' is one of the most boring and tepid movies I've had the misfortune of viewing . Hollywood really has run out of ideas . . . . . special effects alone does not make a great movie !
24547|1|boooooring . . . . .
24549|1|this movie definitely has a thrown-together feel to it . a shabby one at that . apparently it's people were racing with the makers of red planet to get theirs out first . but red planet kinda sucked too .
24558|1|Incredibly horrible version of the classic H . G . Wells story , with ludicrously bad performances from everyone . Whatever happened to Jeremy Irons ? He used to be a pretty good actor once upon a time . I'll tell you one thing , I would NEVER want to have to go up against that guy on the old game show " Make Me Laugh . " Decent actor , but his career isn't merely going down the toilet , it's clogged in the pipes .
24561|1|My rating is for the new version of Time Machine . The original version gets 5 stars from me . The new version is simply a politically correct , diversity seeking stupid waste of money . The whole theme of the novelette was ignored in favor of knocking white people and praising anyone with brown skin . And why move the setting from London to New York ? Don't waste your time with this movie ( even if you agree with the politics , you are wasting your money . See the original version instead ) .
24563|1|This movie was horrible and boring . I would not recommend this version of Time Machine to anyone . Don't bother renting the tape either , you'll just be wasting your money . Like most films made by Hollywood today , this one showed their anti-White nature . The Morlocks , the bad guys , had blond hair and their mind control leader was a glow-in-the-dark Aryan , who was also bad . According to this story , mankind evolved into two species , the dark skinned mixed race , who were portrayed as completely good in nature and the blond race creatures and their Aryan mind controller , who were portrayed as evil . The bad blonds ate the dark skinned people , but this was never shown . The 'hero' of this boring flick killed all the mutated Aryans and freed the mixed race from their horrible oppression of being food . Jewish hollywood never misses a chance to portray blonds in a negative manner . H . G . Wells would hate this version of his book since he was well aware of Aryan history ( he wrote on the subject ) and to see his movie take on anti-Aryan sentiments would have inflamed him . I may have described this film in an exciting way , but it was really dull and predictable even if you haven't read the book . The 'hero' uses his time machine to blow up all the bad people and then he stays in the future . The movie is also anti-technology by saying mankind took his knowledge too far . In the 'hero's' first couple of jumps into the future , he sees that mankind ( Whites ) destroyed the moon causing all society to collapse . All that is left in the far off future is the mixed race 'good people' and the mutated White 'bad' race . All the action parts of the film I mentioned were very brief , so don't go see the movie because of the narrative I spoke on . Basically this film was nothing more than anti-White , anti-technology propaganda with little entertainment value . No wonder it tanked at the box office . And , if you rent it , you will only be wasting your time . It's also no wonder movies do not offer a satisfaction guarantee .
24565|1|Boy , did this suck . Emilio Estevez being chased by Mick Jagger on a moped is the stuff of nightmares . A preposterous waste of time .
24566|1|Lori Petty , I hope this movie affected your career .
24572|1|This is a bad movie , no question . In general this movie consists of several men wanting to screw Jane Fonda who is naked on and off throughout the movie . This movie is some sort of musical style science fiction movie if it is possible for such a thing to exist . I have not seen many things worse than this piece of manure , and I find the film to be generally disgusting . I suppose you might want to rent this if you haven't seen Jane Fonda naked , but there are many other women who look better than her naked .
24579|1|Oh George . . . what were you thinking ? This film made no sense at all . Where was the story again ? In this film set in outer space , Clooney finds that he has come in contact with his deceased wife , and has to cope with everything going on around him . What I didn't understand is why he didn't want her back , even though he loved her so much . Clooney was totally forced .
24581|1|This thing stinks on ice .
24588|1|Bored me soooooooo much . One of those films that you wind up almost falling asleep on a bunch of times , and it's also one of those ones that , for no good reason , you stupidly feel that you are somehow obligated to watch the whole thing . Then you wind up kicking your own ass for wasting two precious hours on this dreck .
24589|1|Angelina Jolie STILL sucks .
24590|1|Overrated stinkorama . Some of the bad SCI-FI movies Mystery Science Theater 3000 makes fun of was better than this snorefest . Supposedly , the entire scenery and background was computer animated . If that's the case , then I was praying for the Blue Screen of Death to pop up and get me out of this . So utterly boring , the drab background was dull and unimaginative . Even the Fx stunk . The planes looked plain dumb . The story was like some 9th rate film noir by some rookie hack . Absolutely zero chemistry between Jude Law and Apple's mom . I used to like Jude Law ( especially in Talented Mister Ripley ) , but his string of stinkers ( Alfie , Closer , and this detritus ) makes him the latest actor to go shark jumping . We may only remember him as the dude who stood next to Ashlee Simpson when she complained about acid reflux on SNL .
24591|1|Utter garbage . If Jude Law's career can survive that it can survive anything .
24592|1|This movie was basically a carbon copy of something from the early 50's . Gwenyth Paltrow's character was as annoying as she was deceiptful and Sky Captain was pretty much Batman in a plane .
24600|1|Dreadful , cheesy and corny " remake " of the original , which was a minor classic , and whatever else it may have been , and it was pretty cheesy in its own right , the original was a fairly unique and influential landmark in the development of sci- fi films . The makeup was indeed very good , and Tim Roth did a good job as usual , but the rest of this movie was atrocious . The plot in particular was abysmal .
24602|1|Atrocious acting . Stupid script . No amount of great special effects or hi-tech makeup jobs could salvage this heap of dung . SEE THE ORIGINAL ! ! !
24610|1|two hours of mark whalberg is bad enough . two hours of mark , acting in a movie that was just fine the first time around was just too much .
24611|1|heh , amazing . . . ly stupid . DONT SEE THIS MOVIE . you watch it for an hour and a half uninterested and you see the ending and want to commit suicide becuase it doesnt make any sense at all . DONT SEE THIS MOVIE .
24623|1|What happened to character development ? I found this film to be an empty waste of my time . Walberg was OK , Bonham-Carter was great considering her beauty was smothered by the silly monkey costume . I just didn't buy it . It seemed to me that the assumption was made that the apes would follow the path of human development but would just retain some of their more hostile animal traits . I felt like the apes got ripped off here but I guess I was the one that got ripped off for shelling out 5 . 75 for this pitiful excuse for a film .
24634|1|This movie was horrible . They took out all the interesting and freaky parts that were in the original . They seemed to be more interested in fighting scenes and chases than any of the subtle freaky parts that were in the first movie . The humans spoke English . . which I found weird . Mark Wahlberg . . . although may be nice to look at . . is a horrible actor . He was not convincing at all . . . especially in his uplifting speech to the humans ! Save your money . . watch the original when it comes on TV again .
24637|1|shat
24638|1|Blah .
24639|1|If only it had been the final movie as well .
 2464|1|Could any of the people in this movie act ?
24641|1|Bad Shatner ! Bad ! No more writing ! Anything ! Ever !
24648|1|Kirk meets god and it not impressed . You can tell that Shatner directed it ! ! A big pile of Cack ! !
24649|1|Not a Star Trek fan- never liked it . It's so boring . Never liked the plot of it .
24658|1|Putrid movie that just stops , as opposed to ends . Mediocre animation combined with a bizarre " live action " animation technique that falls well short of adequacy .
24664|1|Does this movie even deserve a comment ?
24667|1|It's prob'ly been done , but hey - Ohhhh , the pain ! The Pain !
24668|1|When I first read the list of cast members for this film based on the old TV show , I was very impressed by the selection for Dr . Smith . However , about five minutes in , I sadly came to the realization ; even the considerable talents of Gary Oldman could not save this hideously convoluted film rendition of that well-known 1960's TV show . As a matter of fact , if you watched the show back in its original form , the only thing that will seem even mildly familiar to you here will be the names of each character . Beyond that , forget trying to relate anything else to the Lost in Space you once knew . You expect the pace to be quick , but this goes beyond that - hitting warp speed from the get go and never slowing down . This way too zippy non-stop action leaves little time left for character development or , at times , even coherent dialog . The result is that you not only do not care about the characters but at times you can't even follow what is supposed to be going on . It really made me wonder what the person responsible for this mess was thinking when the movie was tossed together . Apparently their goal was to throw in a little of this and that from just about every popular Sci-Fi extravaganza to hit the screen since Star Wars . Either that , or they were actually trying to confuse the audience into believing the story may have had some substance . If that was the case , they didn't manage to include enough . Sadly , they also did not manage to capture the light and appealing Sci-Fi quality that originally was Lost in Space .
24669|1|If you try to make a movie out of a bad show , then what are you trying to accomplish ? ? ? Nothing . And you get nothing out of this high-budget film that doesn't get anywhere .
24673|1|Very horrible movie ! could've been better .
24674|1|This movie is real crappy man !
24677|1|This movie is awful from the start . It opens with a couple of scientists chasing down a 500 pound , invisible gorilla without acting the least bit concerned . The villian of this story is a crazed , invisble and completely naked Kevin Bacon . I mean what the HELL ! After sitting through the whole thing I can't figure out why this was allowed to be made or why it is called a thriller .
24685|1|Ugh ! The premise of this movie is compelling . . the invisible man . . blah blah blah . However , Hollow Man just doesn't cut it . The special effects are sometimes impressive , but the content ( plot , acting , etc . . ) are as invisible as Kevin Bacon . As the plot lessens , so does the clothing on the women in the movie . I guess they decided to rely on gratuitous boob shots rather than put some actual thought into the making of this movie . I will admit that there were some ( few ) suspenseful moments . . but about halfway through ( if not sooner ) the movie becomes so predictable and the ending is so over the top it is ridiculous . Don't waste your money or 2 hours of your life on this bomb .
24692|1|Terrible , terrible , terrible . It should be called Shakin' Bacon , because it is all about Kevin ! And no way could Elizabeth Shue save her boyfriend by using a burning barrel .
24697|1|All flash , no substance . Looks like the pervert wanted his set fantasies acted out in front of him and then decided to write a plot around the scenes . The film could've been profound but instead it ws superficial , poorly put together , and basically the epitome of the TRASH that is churned out by Hollywood presently . It's sickening .
24708|1|I didn't think this movie was very good because the ending ruined the whole movie . The special effects were good but the way that Kevin Bacon dies like three times isn't very pleasing .
24709|1|Hollow Man bombed . The movie had great effects but the story turned out to be very bad . The chick in the movie was hot .
 2471|1|You know , where do I begin with the pile of trash ? First of all , I refuse to believe a tornado is powerful enough to whip a cow around 700 times , but isn't powerful enough to throw the truck they drive off the road . Oh , and Id swear the plot of this movie simply revolved around knocking over tornado tracking devices ! Hellooooo , is there any intelligence left in Hollywood ? ? ? And I love the fact that the tornado comes , clouds are black . . . YET NOT ONE DROP OF FREAKIN RAIN ! And if I see a tornado , I don't know about you , but I'm running the opposite direction , I sure as hell aint going to chase it down like these retarded idiots ! The movie sucked !
24710|1|I found Hollow Man to be a very boring movie . I went in to the theater thinking it would be scary and left very disappointed . The only good thing about it were the special effects .
24716|1|The special effects hardly make up for what the movie lacked in plot . Besides , it promotes animal cruelty ( I overheard someone saying that the movie sucked , but the coolest part was when a dog's head was crashed against the wall . . . I bet they went home to try it . ) .
24718|1|Don't watch this movie , waste of money . Don't rent this movie , waste of money . All the good scenes are already in the previews .
24723|1|Badly written , poorly filmed , dreadfully acted hogwash .
24724|1|A horrible overrated movie that was popular for Angelina Jolie's looks and nothing else . The plot and character development was one of the worst i'd ever seen .
24730|1|Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap . Even though this movie was supposedly action-packed , I was completely bored with this one . The characters were absolutely retarded and the directing was infantile . The writer must have forgotten to include a story when writing the script . Argh ! ! ! The only thing that grabbed my attention was Angelina Jolie's boobs bouncing up and down when she moved . Kudos for that Stupid Guy Who Directed Tomb Raider . I wish there was more blood , but noooooo , we have to keep that PG-13 rating , don't we ?
24734|1|I loath this film . What a waste of the talented Miss Angelina Jolie and production costs . They could have made twelve films the size of Girl , Interrupted with that budget . There is no plot . There is no entertaining action sequences . There are no interesting characters . There are no interesting back stories . There are parts where they tried to add in comic relief but it came off as dull pointless chatter . Most of the dialouge in this film was so mind numbing all I could hear were clicking sounds . Angelina Jolie is still one very attractive woman and this film proves it once again , yes , I would like to get hot and heavy with this vixen . Beyond that this film has nothing . Absolutly nothing . It is a summer movie . But those are usually entertaining ! I have never been so bored in an action film in my entire friggin life ! There is a funny part though . In the beginning there is a shower scene with Lara Croft ( Which shows more skin than the usual PG-13 fair ) and later on is a part where we think we are about to be treated to another Lara Croft shower scene , when all of a sudden it pans down to reveal . . . A MAN ! ! ! Only laugh out loud part of the movie . All the guys were like OH yea ! ! ! Then the camera pans down to reveal a square chin covered in stubble and a receeeding hair line AHHH SH * T , MAN ! Great moment . I wonder if the film makers did this intentionally ?
24735|1|ugh .
24738|1|Allthough Halle Berry did her best-this movie didn't stick to the true story of Catwoman the the Batman comics . Whomever wrote the scrip was probbaly high on crack and screwed up everything !
24741|1|I agree with 'The Slacker' . . . AND . . . there was way too much of Halle's overrated ass and not nearly enough of her acting in this movie . But . . . oops . . . I forgot . . . she can't act .
24745|1|Terrible ! Halle Berry what were you thinking ? The storyline is stupid , the acting is boring , and the plot never takes off . No chemistry at all between Benjamin Bratt and Halle Berry , oh and that terrible Catwoman suit and boots . The movie should be in the comedy category , instead of action movie . The critics were right on the money this time .
24751|1|Do I smell something bad ? Yes I do . . . it's this movie .
24753|1|Boring garbage featuring a worse than normal performance from Stallone . ( Which is saying a lot . ) So dull it should have been called " Judge Fred . "
24755|1|Ridiculously pathetic . Two thumbs down .
24761|1|The most incomprehensible movie I've ever seen . Just awful .
24763|1|If we're talking about the first one with James Caan made in the '70s its probably worth 3 stars . If we're talking about the more recent waste of celluloid , it barely deserves one .
24767|1|Home dentistry is more fun than this piece of crap .
24769|1|one name--LL Cool J-should tell you how good this film is .
24770|1|Godawful nonsense . Jeremy Irons seems hell bent on destroying his career and whatever scraps of dignity he once had .
24771|1|10 year olds could have come up with a better plot , and I got really sick of all the CGI shots of the exteriors of the buildings in the main city .
24772|1|Only two things kept me watching . 1 . Jeremy Irons ridiculously hammy acting . 2 . Damodars blue lipstick ( wtf ? ) . The dwarf in this movie has to be the lamest dwarf I've ever seen , it would have been awesome if Gimli came into the picture and decapitated him with his axe .
24778|1|What a waste ! The SFX looked good , but I wonder how did they persuade Jeremy Irons to do that . . . . maybe they got him drunk and gave him the contract to sign . I fell asleep after 15 minutes .
24779|1|I cannot even begin to tell you how incredibley dull and pathetic an attempt of film making this was .
24780|1|Bad in every way .
24791|1|This deserves zero stars and three additional turkeys . Now , I shall sheepishly admit that I read a couple of the Anne Rice vampire potboilers to see what all the hype was about . Therefore I knew who Lestat was , but since I didn't read the book that this bow-wow is based upon , I was totally lost . I go to a used video store once in a while to shop for bargain dvd's and this chestnut is always in the cheapo bin . That should tell you something .
24792|1|Starring Hillary ?
24793|1|One of the worst vampire movies ever . I can't think of even one good scene in the whole mess . Pure hell all the way thru . . . don't waste your time . . .
24795|1|Bad acting , some woman replaced Louis & took all his parts to make Lestat look less gay , didn't follow the book at ALL , Laestat didn't match his character description one bit , Marius is NOT Lestat's creator , vampires are supposed to be elegant & beautiful , not skinhead stoners , & Akasha's death sceen was really overdone .
24797|1|Read the book , this movie is lacking the entire story line , it sucks . The books are truly great .
24805|1|John " Revolting " outdid himself here in trying to put some oomph in his Scientology beliefs . This film is really awful , but you should watch it at least in part to get the flavor of the hilarious nature of Scientology beliefs .
24806|1|Godawful movie , perhaps the worst of its kind . It's absolutely terrible , the one saving grace is that it's unintentionally hilarious at times . And yet , it's one of those films where , after a while , you'll stop laughing at how bad it is and the depth of how much it sucks will sink in .
24807|1|This is the most horrid POS I've ever witnessed in my life . I'll sum up it's stupidity in one sentence . Cavemen flying 1000 year old harrier jets . interested ? watch it to see how bad it is .
24813|1|Astonishing . Seldom has so much time , talent , energy and money in such a triumphantly atrocious piece of dog excrement . Has to be seen to be believed .
24814|1|After seeing this I thought to myself , I really should have listened to those critics . This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . After a thousand years of slavery the human race has forgotten everything that made them human . They didn't even know what a triangle was and yet they managed to learn how to fly , assemble a nuclear device and devise a plan to wipe out their enemies with their planet . And the makers of this crap had the gall to set up for a sequel . The only part I enjoyed was when Tavolta tried feeding the guy a rat .
24819|1|How can anyone give this piece of crap more than one star . This movie is terrible , we're talking Plan Nine from Outerspace terrible . I admire Travolta's misguided efforts to bring one of the works of his demigogue to life . However , this book is a bad book , and bad books only make bad movies . I can only assume that all of the actors with any name recognition were followers of Scientology , and that is the only reason why this film was not locked into a vault . The unbelievable nature of the film cannot be denied . No one beyond the age of four could possibly be held in disbelief for one simple reason : gold is not the most presious metal on the planet , let alone the universe . The plot and reality mistakes just get worse as the movie goes on . Do not consider this movie unde any circumstances .
24821|1|Horrible movie . Bad , bad , Bad !
24822|1|Why ? Why did they make this movie ? What was going on in the filmmakers mind . I feel very sorry for myself for not listening to my friends advice when they warned me about not seeing BATTLEFIELD EARTH . This movie sucks . No stars .
24825|1|What was Travolta thinking ? Barbarino in space . I kept falling asleep the first time so I thought I'd better watch it again . It was just as bad the second time . Some of the fx were cool but not good enough . I remember panning for gold when I was a kid and getting those big gold bars , NOT ! Did Terl give them the smelting equipment ? No . I can't beleave anyone set out to make a film this bad . Makes me wonder what was left on the cutting room floor . It's to bad that Rate It ! wont let me give it ZERO STARS .
24827|1|I haven't read the book , but this was THE worst sci-fi movie I have EVER seen . Even though the special effects were pretty good , the story was SO bad , that it's not even worth going to the movies for the effects . It's simply bad .
24831|1|John Travolta keeps making this kind of movie and he will be back to playing Vinny Barbarino on Welcome Back !
24832|1|Rutger Hauer is a cyborg warrior who helps earth fight for its existence in an apocalyptic scenario . Avoid at all costs !
24833|1|This horrid , early 80's fantasy / sci-fi flick , that I think was a foreign film made in Italy or something , has to stand as one of the worst films of that genre . So bad it's almost , almost watchable in a self tormenting sort of way . It's utterly dreadful , but at least it's better than Battlefield Earth . Slightly reminiscent of Beastmaster , but twenty times worse , and , to sort of recall Dennis Miller's joke about HBO , twenty times as likely to be on HBO or Preview around the clock circa 1983 , if you can believe it .
24834|1|Head for the bomb shelter , Martha--they've dropped the big stink bomb !
24835|1|Hilariously awful fourth incarnation of the Highlander series . The plot ( if it could be called that ) is little more than a rushed , contrived and poorly acted segway to the next action scene , none of which are very good . An obviously strained effort to cash in on the TV series of the same name .
24838|1|If I could rate this movie with negative stars , I would . When I heard about this project , I was excited for months . My favorite book , to be made into a 2 part miniseries ! I had such high hopes for it . Great cast , with incredible potential , the screencaps looked amazing ( I will give it that , the sets and costumes were bang on ) . Even the music was good , using 'The Mystic's Dream' by Loreena McKennitt as the theme . However , none of that could make up for the horrible butchering of the story , seemingly for entertainment's sake . Granted , I only saw that last 2 hours of the film . But after that , I have no intention of ever seeing that first 2 . I won't spoil it for anyone that , for whatever cracked out reason , wants to see it , but when I saw Viviane's death , I became mildly violent . I'm actually getting fairly angry just remembering it , so I'll leave off by saying DON'T WATCH IT . At all . Especially ( and I can't stress this enough ) , if you're a fan of the book .
 2496|1|So very , very fake .
 2514|1|Western movies r so boring
 2544|1|i love kungfu movies , and i have to say jackie chan is particularly stupid . his buffonery reminds me of charlie chaplin of 100 years ago . wow , he does his own stunts . hello , thats because he can't act . oh wait , i have a remarkable idea ! HE SHOULD GET AN ACTING DOUBLE . this movie , like all jackie chan movies , sucks big time .
 2554|1|This movie was totally gay . It was another stupid gay ass plot for Jackie Chan . I wish I could kick his ass and get my money back .
 2618|1|This movie was disturbing . The effects were pretty good but that didn't make up for the terrible plot .
 2623|1|This movie sucked ! It was written and directed by very sick minds . I hope children don't watch this movie . I can't imagine anyone wanting to see such a sick movie . Everyone who saw it at the theatre agreed that it sucked and should never have been made . The director should stick to fashion designing for himself . The writer should be seeking professional help and not be allowed to share such dementia with the world .
 2635|1|Towering imbecility .
 2656|1|lol . . . im going to have to agree wth irishgit
 2660|1|Unfortunately , the damn movie was still there after sixty seconds . It took over a hundred minutes for it to leave .
 2698|1|A very special kinda movie for a very special kinda person . . nuff said .
 2719|1|Will someone please stop Banderas before he acts again ! !
 2726|1|Sucked sooo much - cannot believe humans actually ( a ) consider this entertainment ( b ) think Cameron Diaz is pretty ( c ) think Cameron Diaz can act ( d ) actually paid money to see this
 2730|1|ok the actresses are very cheap looking in both movies ! ! ! !
 2731|1|sucked
 2735|1|Better name for this movie 3 woman acting dumb stupid , and air headed ! ! ! Movie sucked ! ! ! !
 2745|1|The movie had a good plot but the acting from Cameron Diaz completely ruined the story , it made me sick to watch her . It strayed too far from the original Charlies Angels , it dissapointed me .
 2749|1|Good grief ! It's a zero ! A re-make of the seventies flick that went out of date in the seventies ! Three boobs given superhuman capabilities to beat up on all the bad guy's ? Gimme a break !
 2755|1|I'm sorry for all Cahrlie fans but I think the movie was terrible , a total waste of money and time !
 2776|1|Ahh puke ! We got rid of this stupid show in the 70's and now they brought it back . The only redeeming aspect is Bill Murray and even he cannot outway the lack of plot and stupidity of the idea . And Drew Barrymore , ohh , I am near vomitting , I'm not going to make it , bleechhh !
 2823|1|Bond movies ended when they ran out of books to base them on . Brosnan is utterly unconvincing , the plot is minimal and ludicrous , the casting belongs on a BBC TV sitcom . Give up before they devalue the quality of those made pre 1975
 2842|1|if i ever wanted to see such crap again id head straight to a toilet
 2851|1|As far as I was concerned this movie didn't need to wait for another day to die . It was pretty much dead up ther on the screen .
 2853|1|This movie sucks . Worst Bond movie ever made , well it beats Casino Royale , but even AVTAK and NSNA are better than DAD .
  286|1|No way should this have beaten Traffic for best movie .
 2870|1|Ludicrous nonsense . Somehow manages to be even stupider than the book it's based on .
 2872|1|sucked - Travolta at his worst , though I give the guy credit for so effectively milking one good comeback performance in Pulp Fiction for so damn long
 2880|1|Boy , is this an awful movie ! I watched about 25 minutes of it and couldn't take any more . It was extremely violent , and the plot was difficult to follow . John Travolta was just terrible in his role , and I was appalled by Halle Berry . She should be ashamed of herself for taking a part in which her claim to fame is showing off her breasts in gratuitous nude scenes . Talk about pathetic ! There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this film- avoid it at all costs .
 2881|1|Good God this movie is bad . Everything about it is so convoluted , the actions , characters , motives , emotions and the overall screenplay seemed oversimplified and really forced and unnatural . I don't know why Travolta keeps getting cast as the villain , he makes a good effort but honestly he's not that good at it . There are plenty of more convincing villains like keifer sutherland or gary sinise .
 2883|1|The most God awful film I have seen in a long time . I'd rather see American Pie 2 again and that is saying alot . Halle Berry should keep her top on , YIKES ! Well , for half a mill , I'd probably whip it out . What a great idea for an add campaign , SWORDFISH - starring Halle Berrie's unattractive saggin boobs ! Wow , the fim makers waisted their money . And i waisted my time . DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ! ! !
 2896|1|How this film made so much money is a mystery to me . Okay , the villain of the piece is . . . . a big storm . . . that everyone knows about . . . but our protagonists don't care . . . because thar be fish in dem dar waves . George Clooney and Mark Walberg are both talented actors but not even their skills can overcome corny dialogue and a story that may make for good reading but makes for excrutiating viewing .
 2897|1|Terrible movie . The book was incredibly bad . Poor job by geroge clooney . under no circumstances would i suggest seeing this waste of time .
 2905|1|It boggles the mind that the vast majority of people posting ratings on this website rate this worthless piece of celluloid junk a 4 or better on a scale of 1 to 5 . The formulaic script and shockingly pedestrian direction ( especially for the Director of Das Boot ) are bad enough , but the dialogue is the capper : Clooney's last line in the film ( shouted at a wave ) is one of the most laughable in film history . I loved the book , but the translation is terrible . Completely missing from the film is the very interesting way in which the storm's development was followed and tracked by meteorologists . Instead , the film creates a false and terribly underdeveloped story about a weatherman who does nothing more than point at a computer screen and say wow . Also lacking is development about the Navy rescue divers ( although I found that story to be somewhat distracting in the book ) . In sum , this translation of an excellent book ended up being a schizophrenic mess , filled more with insipid and flaccid love stories than the drama that drove the real life event . I strongly recommend that if you are a thinking person , even one who really enjoys a great bubble gum flick as I do , do not even waste a buck renting this garbage on dollar night .
 2907|1|I don't have much to say about The Perfect Storm because I watched it for 30 minutes and then fell sound asleep . I just couldn't get into it . The characters were forgettable , and it took too long for the action to kick in . Most of the movie was shot in shadows or in the dark , which probably contributed to my sleepiness . My husband watched the whole thing , though , and he said he enjoyed it . I'll take his word for it- there's no way I'd try watching it again !
 2909|1|Slow . Not exciting at all . Some okay parts but the acting was not very good and there was never an exciting climax .
  292|1|Stupid inferior remake of Tony Mann's great film The Fall of the Roman Empire . Forget Gladiator , watch The Fall of the Roman Empire . Russell Crowe is idiotic in this film .
 2958|1|Yuck .
 2959|1|Waste of time . Good thing i didnt pay for that movie . Only good thing that came out of the movie was Julianne Moore , shes somthing to look at .
 2972|1|After just reading the book , I thought the movie deleted too many essential characters and left out too many important facts that would have explained things in the movie . The movie seemed out of kelter with the book in several spots , almost as if they had to put them in the movie but not in the order they were in the book . Overall , the movie just plain sucked . The actress that played Clarice Starling was horrible . I think if Joddie Foster had played in it , her abilities would have been so much better . The entire movie seemed like a clinical manual void of the emotion and horror that fuled the first movie .
 2976|1|Before I saw Hannibal I knew that it would and could never live up to Silence of the Lambs . A few months before the film even opened , I heard of all the A-List Talents that were behind this film . Editor Pietro Scalia ( Good Will Hunting ) , Screenwriter Steven Zaillian ( Schindler's List ) and David Mamet ( Probably the Greatest Modern American Playwright ) are all part of the creative process that you'd think this movie would at least be a good sequel to a fantastic modern masterpiece . Then comes Ridley Scott , who , in my opinion is a hot and cold director . He directed such great films like Gladiator , Thelma and Louise and Blade Runner . But his resume also states he directed G . I . Jane , White Squall and 1492 : Conquest of Paradise . ( Need I say more ? ) After seeing the film , you really can't blame Sir Anthony Hopkins or Julianne Moore for this terrible love story masquerading as a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game . The blame truly goes to Ridley Scott here . This film is so awful that you can see the actors , and the creative team trying their best to make something out of bad material since it is the sequel to Silence . At times the screenplay delivers some witty reparte , and the language that Hannibal Lecter uses sometimes captures the original's rhythm and feel . There are great moments with John Mathieson's cinematography , especially the scenes in Italy and Hans Zimmer's score is one of his best in my opinion . But the pacing was so inconsistent , and the chemistry between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins feel forced . Julianne Moore does her best to a role that truly doesn't belong to her and Anthony Hopkins looks freaky alright , but his performance at times feel a bit paint-by-numbers . There are plenty of holes unfilled in the plot too . ( Why can't we know more about Hannibal's past caretaker , Barney ? He's a really interesting guy ! If Hannibal's in the ten most wanted list of the FBI , how did he ever make it through Airport Security ? If everyone is using the internet to catch Hannibal since the internet is loaded with Hannibal information , why is he so hard to find ? ) There are some really stupid moments in the film . For example , for ten years the FBI has been trying their best to capture our beloved Cannibal but it takes two seconds for three Italian thugs to knock him out and dump him in the back of a van . . . WITH A TASER GUN ! Oh and the final ten minutes of the film is so ridiculous you leave the theatre laughing at how low filmmakers can go with gore . And the brain eating scene just gives you a headache ( literally ) because it's so contrived and it feels so set up for the audience to squiggle and squirm that it comes off as one of the corniest gags in Hollywood History . I wonder what Jonathan Demme has to say after seeing the sequel to his original ?
 2978|1|If bad movies were a crime , Ridley Scott would get LIFE imprisonment ! I'm mad as hell that this movie has made so much money in its first week ! and I wish there was a way that we could all get our money back ! ! sir Anthony Hopkins was an idiot for accepting the role . . . . He has lost the respect as a esteemed actor as far as Im concerned ! Jodie Foster probably turned it down because she read the script and saw that it SUCKED ! !
 2984|1|This movie . . . it just plan old blew . . . . i mean it was all hype . . . if you liked it . . . well your dumb . . . . or are brain dead !
 2985|1|I anticipated this movie ever since i heard they were gonna make it . Biggest mistake of my life , this movie was TERRIBLE . HUGE disappointment , ending was terrible , the movie was funny rather than scary .
 2990|1|Wicked is right , and I don't mean tht in a good way . This movie is pure evil to have to watch . I would rather turn in my blockbuster card rather than risk accidently renting this horrid excuse for a action / dectective movie . I saw it once , and , beleive me , that was one time to many .
 3034|1|This movie was so disappointing . First , it was not believeable at all . The sequence of events and the characters reactions to the events were contrived . Also , the movie glorifies police brutality , which is particularly disturbing as John Singleton directed it . Also , Latinos are stereotyped as drug lords . All in all , the movie was quite offensive .
 3077|1|I'm just trying to move this movie off of the top 20
 3098|1|Bad , bad , bad , really , really really bad . I think 20 minutes was just close ups of Bruce Willis making Bruce Willis faces . BLah .
 3104|1|Horrid epic with miscast Bruce Willis stuck in lamebrained , overblown action scenes . The screenplay could be the greatest since The Adventures Of Pluto Nash .
 3116|1|Yet another execrable example of Hollywood bastardising history . What is it with the US mainstream film industry that it can't help re-writing history to make the US come out the winner everytime . Propaganda of the most sick making sort .
 3120|1|This is a disgrace to every British sailor that risked his life to obtain the German enigma and its code book .
 3122|1|it was the brits who did it all , the americans were not involved . dont cry people , no americans died here , so of course no one died worth crying about . i wonder , if the film had been made with english accents and the subs were called 'HMS whatever' instead of 'SS whatever' would this film have ever been even seen in the US . somehow i dont think so . this makes me sick . claiming the heroic deeds of the british as your own and not mentioning them at all .
 3123|1|Dull , boring , uninteresting , uninspired , unorigional , complete BS . Take your pick they're all true . I got bored with this movie after nazis with knives started jumping out of every corner one at a time only to get shot in the head . I was waiting for that tired old cliche ` where a black cat would jump out hissing . If you want a good World War 2 film try Saving Private Ryan or one of many other films about W . W . 2 .
 3161|1|Aweful . This movie's story was so insulting ! Jet had some pretty sweet fight scenes , but if that is all I wanted to see I would go down to the local dojo . If you like blood and WWF-like drama , this movie is for you . If you want something for your ticket price , then go see something else !
 3187|1|poop
 3191|1|this is just another pathetic Rambo rip-off . please people , try to get a little original . I have seen enough movies where 1 man outsmarts an entire army .
 3196|1|never seen such a worse acting duo . Gene Hackman , king of cheeseball movies , and Owen Wilson , up and coming cheeseball king . Couple of fruits , badddddd movie .
   32|1|Crap
  320|1|I hated this movie ! 15 minutes of action , 15 minutes of bordom , 15 minutes of action . . . Go for Braveheart .
 3212|1|This is where it all started . Meg Ryan the cheater ! ! I have no respect for any person that can't keep her pant's up while she or he is away from the family ! ! !
 3216|1|The only indication you get of the two main characters having an affair is one lousy kiss . They hardly even talk about being involved or anything . It's very dissapointing .
 3220|1|I have never been so bored in all my life . All talent used in this movie was wasted . The plot was lacking , the idea itself was lacking , all the characters lacked . This movie never gets off the ground . It seems to sit on its keyster and through out sperattic action hostage flick cliches . But , they are clever when they do this . By boring you to tears a little explosion or a motorist getting blown to bits by machine gun fire is a welcome happening even though it adds nothing to the film . My advice STAY FAR FAR AWAY .
 3224|1|I have to give this movie a terrible rating because it re-enforces sterotypes and the storyline makes no sense unless the point is that white men are more valuable than anyone else . All the South American Rebels are portrayed as trigger happy druggies , which justifies slitting their throats and setting up a battle for the gurrila group to get slaughtered by the army sponsered by corporate intrests , all so that the main charactor's husband can be rescued .
 3225|1|This film should have been subtitled No minorities were injured in the making of this film . The movie almost brings up real issues ( oil companies and dams and corporate America ) , but then quickly turns back to the cheesy romance and good guy / bad guy senario . Funny how the bad guy is the South American revolutionary and the good guy is the rich white American male . And somehow they manage to blame it all on drugs . Obviously those minorities only want to hold people ransom and attack the oil project so they can protect their cocaine crop . And somehow they manage to make it be okay to go shoot the minorities if they are saving a couple of white guys . Talk about cultural insensitivity and racism . The movie simply enforced age-old stereotypes .
 3230|1|sucked , an insult to those real vets . Precision bombing in World War II ? Please , those planes dumped their bombs and ran , people below be damned .
 3238|1|Go away Pierce Brosnan /
 3241|1|Just another slutty James Bond movie .
 3244|1|Pierce Brosnan should stick to Remmington Steel because James Bond was finished when Sean Connery finished . You are right , to World is not Enough for . . . . me to poop on .
 3257|1|For this movie to have such big time actors in it , it sucked terribly !
 3262|1|CRAP
 3264|1|This is perhaps one of the worst action movies of all time . First of all , it is so removed from the premise of the original Mission : Impossible series that people wouldn't even recognize it as a sequel were it not for the title . Second , the plot is as predictable as they come : a bad man wants to threaten the world with a virus and the hero has to stop him , plus the girl is in danger ; give me a break . Third , there is a truckload of slow-mo action scenes that might look good in the first minutes , but then they become tiresome since the amount of them has to be seen to be believed . Fourth , the action scenes are so over-the-top as to be ridiculous : Hunt ( Cruise ) can avoid bullets and perform stunts so exhaggerated as to be utterly laughable . Fifth , the movie has so many plot holes and absurdities as to be completely irritating : whenever Hunt has to infiltrate the bad guys' team , he wears a mask and can impersonate anyone , even people who were never seen before , or who are taller or fatter , whatever . At one point , one of the bad guys is killed because Hunt makes him wear a mask of himself . Just imagine , Hunt was carrying a mask of HIMSELF ! How's that for deus ex machina . And what about the virus that is transmitted through blood in certain scenes , then suddenly is supposed to be airborne 'cause otherwise the plot wouldn't work ? Pathetic . Sixth , the movie copies left and right from superior movies ; most of it is pale imitation of Bond movies , and the rest is taken from some Hitchcock's classics or superhero movies ( yeah , Cruise is also so strong in this film that he could rival Superman ) . All in all Mission : Impossible II is one of the worst summer movies I've ever seen in my life , and should be avoided like the plague .
 3271|1|I saw this at the cinema with my partner and his family for his b'day during the summer . We were not impressed . There was only one piece of camerawork that I particularly like and that was with the cars . It seems to me that this film doesn't even adhere to the original series and therefore should not have the title . Appalling .
 3292|1|Just like part one , all special effects and all Tom's nose . Nothing more & nothing less . .
 3294|1|I went into the movie expecting a fast paced action thriller with a complicated , well thought out plot . I was disappointed to be confronted with a boring movie with a corny love story . It was one of the worst movies I've seen this year .
 3312|1|This movie is terrible because it re-does every old trick from the first movie . I was not surprised , and was insulted by their pitiful portrayal of one of the only black women in a major role of an action film in a long time .
 3326|1|I'm still on Planet Earth right ? ! ? ! ? Hello ! ! People work with me here . Where to begin , where to begin . How 'bout I walked out of this film in the first half hour and demanded my money back ! I couldn't believe what a parody this was of the first one . I didn't think the first one was fantastic but at least it stayed in line with the type of visuals , acting , and suspense of the show . This thing was just a non-stop oh my god is this cheesey scene after another . When he's rock climbing and jumps 20 feet and DOWN to his right and slides down the rock face until he suddenly grips a protrubing pebble ? ! ! ? Then he decides to turn himself around and hang for a couple of minutes while he stares off into space with a Goddamn I'm cool look on his face . Or the bathtub scene , or the dance floor , or the two cars doing 360 after 360 stuck together . Give me a break !
 3337|1|Sorry , I hated this film . It was very loud , brutal , violent , and WAY too long . The movie ended after an hour , then ended 45 minutes later , then ran out of steam FINALLY after about three and a half hours . As Roger Ebert once said , you can tell a movie is bad when you look at your watch . Then look at it again . Then shake it to see if it's stopped . I would go on about historical inaccuracies . . . . This movie couldn't seem to find a time setting . There were Native Americans doing MARTIAL ARTS . And the Wolf itself , some kind of giant [ badly done ] CGI badger with armor obscuring you from seeing it ( when you finally do see it , they use the standard hiding the monster bit for most of the film ) . If I had to say anything , the photography , settings , and costumes were beautiful . But when the only way you can validate a film is the costumes , you know the plot and chaarcters are lacking . I was completely surprised . I expected a sensible , well-done French Film . What I got was a nonsensical American-style blockbuster .
 3338|1|JET LI CANT FIGHT . HES A BUM .
 3342|1|It could've been good , but ended up being a piece of crap .
 3344|1|This movie sucks . No plot , no talent , no fun action . This movie is Lame ! With a capital L ! Aaliyah needs to stick to her singing and Jet Li needs to find better action script because he can fight , he just isn't a convincing actor . The plot is way to scatter brained and really makes no point to keep the viewer interested . The only redeeming quality of this movie are the shots that show an X-ray of the damage as it is being caused . Hardlly makes up for such a waist of time and money , on both the studios part and on the consumers .
 3380|1|This movie SUCKED ! ! ! ! Pretty boys do not make a movie good .
  339|1|I liked it better the first time I saw it , when it was called BRAVE HEART . There were so MANY events in this movie that was a total copy of BH . It got to the point that I knew what was going to happen 20 minutes before it was even on screen . . . RIP OFF .
 3393|1|Awful , what an insult to those men who died there . Nice hair , Josh . Hey guy , it was 1941 , you were in the military - quasi-homosexual beatle cuts and sideburns were not the order of the day .
 3395|1|OVERRATED .
 3397|1|I really wanted to give an extra * for the bombing and battle scenes , but i just can't . that american flag sinking is not a metaphore for me it is just a terrible clichee . and ok , if you are a woman , the lead actors may be quite appealing , but hey , you can always use the tabloids for that . it is amazing what great actors can do for a buck ( or a lot of bucks ) . I mean , Alec Baldwin should be ashamed for accepting such a trash . As for the dialogue : God help the German Army if there are more like you where you came from-says the British squadroom leader to Affleck's character . Jesus , what was the screenwriter thinking ? ! It is that kind of lame dialogue that can ruin everything in a movie . As for the story . . . At one time , I just wanted to scream : why dont you two just share the bimbo and get it over with ! Love triangle my foot ! Too bad for the actors , but I have to say that I always find something annoying about Ben Affleck , no matter what he does .
 3399|1|A maudlin and simplistic love story during which the Japanese happen to bomb Pearl Harbour . Prettily filmed though .
 3403|1|An appalling piece of garbage , which I had mercifully forgotten until I saw it listed here . One watching it gets the impression that Pearl Harbor was some kind of spectacular American victory , due to the heroics of a few ace fighter pilots . It was no such thing . And one also gets the impression from the movie that the Doolittle raid was a spectacular success which ravaged Japan's industrial machine : it caused very little damage at all ( mainly being a psychological victory ) . The special effects in the movie are good , as they always are , but the acting is laughable and the contrived romantic parts make any watcher with high standards reach for the vomit-pan . Avoid this deformed turkey , there are plenty of better movies .
 3407|1|Dude , the Japanese are bombing us and stuff ! That's not cool at all ! Save for the excellent attack scenes , this mega-bomb of a film is simply wretched . I'm sorry , Ben . You cannot act . Grimacing is not the universal emotion . The politically correct re-telling of Pearl Harbor is any more offensive considering 11 September . What a waste .
 3412|1|Have you ever seen such decent special effects ruined by such awful acting ? Don't make a historical film if you are going to turn it into a cheesy romance film . . . doesn't Hollywood have more respect for old veterans ? Typical Hollywood shlock- overhyped , overdone , overacted . A real dissapointment .
 3415|1|Newsflash -- the exact same subject has been with just as well , if not better , in at least a dozen other movies . Sure , the fx are nice , but whatdehay is the point when the acting and surrounding plot are so insipid ?
 3425|1|My last review of this film was so offensive that they couldn't post it . This sick testament to racist American values left me feeling so sick and cynical as to nearly provoke violence in my otherwise pacifist spirit . This is the worst film that I have ever seen , after Phantasm 2 and countless other sequels , horror schlockfests , and exploitation films . This film insulted my soul . Its paen to romance is a farce in itself , with such flat dialogue that I cannot even remember it to quote it . . . The female lead , Miss Beckinsale , has managed to feign likability eben in the face of her despicably empty foray into quick sex in public , something that I KNOW is viciously empty in itself . But the act is romanticized ! The cinematography and unnecessarily sexy setting alone are ridiculous . When Mr . Hartnett inevitably lays down his racist , war-mongering life for the good old USA , I was moved to laughter . The constant stream of racial slurs delivered by our heroic boys are evocative of the wonderfully propagandist flicks of the war era itself , and their stupid patriotism is so empty as to insult anyone who has ever laid down their life for any country . This is the perfect antithesis to Arlington National Cemetary , to Saving Private Ryan , to the young , innocent dead ! I have never felt guiltier for my nationality , not when standing at the Smithsonian looking at the tribute to the Japanese oppressed by our people in internment camps during WW2 , whose plight was caused by those empty fools who share the morale professed by this sick , sad film , not when reading of the conditions of the slaves whose oppression was enforced by our former presidents . The film left me so ill as to wish the death of the touching conclusion's little boy in Vietnam , being brought up in the vein of his dear daddies , doubtless to become one of the crouching , slurring monuments to blind racism , running through the grass with an automatic weapon and a desire for the blood of an unseen foe , and certainly not enjoying the kill 'em all glory that his fathers managed . . . When he is blown apart by an unseen mine , I wonder what Mr . Affleck's character would do . . . Erect a monument to his heroism . Sick . This film is a sick , war-loving void , whose romance will doubtless result in the philandering of countless impressionable young girls , and whose racist violence is eerily reminiscent of the modern national sentiment toward the Afghanis . . . It's okay to hate , kids ! It's okay to kill . . . Okay . . . This is the most insulting , most vapid , most vile film in my realm of experience . Blasphemy , cruelty , madness and publicity . A bloated , painted devil-whore .
 3432|1|Do movies reflect the personalities of people who make them ? If so , Michael Bay ( Director ) and Jerry Bruckheimer ( Producer ) must have no personalities at all . The characters are only self interested and shallow while the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seemed like it's only purpose was to mess up that little love triangle between the only three characters in the movie . What a bunch of saps .
 3433|1|I saw this movie with my mother-in-law . I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie . It is so bad , so predictable , so cliche filled that you have to laugh at this piece of trash . The battle scenes can't save this . This movie was apparently made for the 12 year old female crowd .
 3440|1|I had been wanting to see this film since the previews started four years or so ago ( Slight exageration ) and by goly if I wasn't disapointed as a small child who receives a Kid Rock C . D . for Christmas . WHAT A WASTE OF TIME . I don't give a damn about a stupid love story ! That isn't what Pearl Harbor was about ! I care about the history not the stupid friggin love triangle thing ! If I wanted that mellow Drama BULL Sh * t I would have gone and seen HERE ON EARTH or some other teeny bopper crap movie with a love triangle in it . Stupid side plots like that have no porpous in what could have been a very fine war drama about America and one of its greatest loses and most horrible disasters . This film should have been titled Pearl Harbor's All That or Sleepless in Pearl Harbor . This movie is a travesty and I am ashamed for ever going to see this peice of trash . What complete poo .
 3448|1|I snuck into this when I was 11 or so . . . ( it was one of the first PG-13 movies ) and it insulted my intelligence then . A bunch of high school brats outsmart communist soldiers and guerrillas ? You've got to be kidding me . And excuse me for howling when that teeny-bopper yells WOLVERINES ! ! ! ! !
 3457|1|Massive disapointment . I am a huge fan of James Patterson the author of all the Alex Cross detective novels and I must say in respect to the novel , this film is a travesty . This film is nothing like the biik which , in retrospect , is much more enjoyable and well thought out . This movie follows the book in no way except that the good guy is Alex Cross and the bad guy is Gary Sonja . This film grows into nothing . You end up feeling nothing for any character at all . And when ah ha moments fail to make you go ah ha . That is a sighn of failure . Kiss the Girls wasn't much better in that respect . Anyway , I recommend reading the books . Stay away from this film or any other film made of this brilliant series of books .
 3471|1|Worst movie I've ever seen . Totally guy stupid . Unrealistic fighting ! ! ! Terrible is an understatement .
 3479|1|Tomorrow Never Dies is one movie that should run to the grave and die , because it's not good at all . Pierce Brosnan should quit the job , because he stinks as James Bond . He can't fight the way that Roger Moore did or get the ladies like George Lazenby did .
 3489|1|This has this distinction of being the only movie to cause me to fall asleep in the theater . Skip it and rent an older Bond flick .
 3490|1|Only slightly better than Austin Powers . But James Bond is still a slut .
 3491|1|why do I keep watching them anymore when I know they'll be pants
 3493|1|I tire of these exercises in trying to look as cool as possible . This movie has no backbone and seems like it was just throw together in order to get some cool poster shots and gratuitous nudity . Not that there's anything wrong with gratutious nudity but nothing about this film is done with any hint of style . Rob Coen needs to direct porn films , I'm sure his style would make more sense in that field . Best Scene : the gratutious nudity
 3494|1|Didn't get through the first 20 m's of it . BORING !
 3499|1|I can't believe this is even on here . One of the worst movies of all time . Terrible acting , ugly cars .
 3502|1|after that dumb movie came out all these riceburner 4 bangers started buzzing up and down the street with their in reality slow cars zigging in n out of traffic . The only good car was the charger n they trashed it . american v8s are a lot cheaper n faster right off the bat ask any mechanic . its just a trend making movie . lots of people escepially girls that dont know anything about cars will flock to it with the shiny head n taillights ( not all girls but alot ) . its really a stupid movie though the things they say in the movie are not factual at all . the second one is probly going to be dumber except for the camaro which i hope they dont trash . i havent seen it yet so miracles can happen .
 3503|1|Imagine watching a drag car race for 90 minutes . The film has an OK premise , but is 89 minutes too long . Interesting performance by newcomer Vin Diesel , but he even seems wasted .
 3513|1|This movie was a waste of time to me . It was so boring that I couldn't pay attention to the movie . do not rent it unless you want money to go down the drain .
 3521|1|It was a chore just to sit through this movie . The whole premise of having to lug nitro glycerine up K2 jsut seems a bit too ridiculous for my tastes . Apparently these people really needed to get new containers for the stuff because the ones they had leaked like nobody's business . Good grief . Best Scene : there isn't one
 3523|1|American can not make a good disater movie anymore .
 3532|1|What in the hell is bobbybo thinking ! Action is all I can say about this movie but was it edge of your seat action ? NO ! Was the acting good ? No ! I hope they stop making the movie the day they come out with it on tape ! ! ! AAAAHHHHH crap
 3534|1|This movie was so bad , even I can't believe it . The movie was designed to throw every possible exciting event at you , one after another , until you are thrilled out of your pants . Instead it was just overkill . I like fantasy as much as the next person but this was so fake and silly I just felt insulted instead . I don't know the first thing about mountain climbing . Or bombs . Or helicopters . But I am intelligent enough to know that 1 ) there's no way even a billionaire could get that many people to show up at a party on K2 . Where did all the cute chicks come from ? Give me a break . And all the mountain climbers partying and drinking beer ? Why aren't they resting for tomorrow's hike ? Puh-leeze . 2 ) There's no way that the Pakistani government would have allowed a team of renegade rescuers to tote leaky cartridges of explosives up some mountain . Also , if you are going to blow someone out of a hole in the mountain you had better get a crack team of precision experts to do it , rather than just sending down a note saying BANG warning the people to get down . There's no way they would have survived that blast . And 3 ) I don't see how that helicopter could have hovered that long to allow the rescue group to jump off without crashing . That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as the ludicrosity of this movie goes . Anyone who rated this movie above a 2 should be ashamed . The producers and directors AND ACTORS ( Chris O'Donnell , I thought higher of you than this ! ) should be ashamed . And the movie studios that keep putting out garbage like this should be ashamed . Yes , I want action and drama , but please give me some action that makes at least a little sense . Please don't insult my intelligence like this . And give me a hero that I can believe in rather than some washed-up , guilt-ridden dude who is a carbon copy of every other action movie I have ever seen ( gee , I bet the writers of this movie watched Cliffhanger while they were thinking of ideas for a hero ! It's the same freakin' story ! ) I ended up having to buy my boyfriend dinner because I dragged him to this lousy movie . He was mad at me for at least an hour after the movie was over . Next time he gets to pick what we see .
 3549|1|Long and dull . They were on a nuclear submarine but didn't bother to bring radiation suits . That's real smart . The endless bickering between Harrison and Liam was annoying at times .
 3578|1|War movies usually suck .
 3579|1|Booorrrrinnnnnggggg ! It's hard to make a war movie that is not at least a little exciting but they did it with this one . I know war is not all guns blazing and people being dismembered . Its a lot of sitting around sleeping , eating , checking equipment and sitting around . The said no one wants to watch a lot of the afore mentioned .
 3581|1|Can a war film be confusing , boring , and pretentious ? Yes it can !
 3582|1|Pretentious , self-indulgent claptrap . Beautifully photographed , it is like a prettily wrapped turd under the Christmas tree .
 3590|1|The worst movie I have ever seen ! I usually like WW2 movies but this movie was missing everything !
 3591|1|By far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life ! I had to wake my boyfriend up so we could leave . Half of the movie theater walked out , I have never seen that happen before .
 3599|1|This not only was one of the most boring military-type movies of all time , it was also the most inaccurate . After watching the movie , I am still not sure what type of unit they were supposedly playing . Anyone that could stay awake for this movie could see the shocking ending from a mile away . The entire set of the movie takes place in Panama with some elite quasi-Ranger type unit doing training . Samuel L . Jackson is the senior non-commissioned officer , though he was wearing specialist rank for a few scenes . The plot was extremely corny and sloppy , with pretty weak character development . One thing I look for in these types of movies is at least some accuracy . . . but I know there are no women in units like this ( score : political correctness 1 - accuracy - 0 ) and usually units that train together dress in the same uniform . I would compare the type of unit to the one in Predator , only this one had no Schwartzaneggar or any other good actors , much less any action . I think the biggest let-down to the movie had to be the ending , where the shock and awe really wants to make you say to yourself , So what ? In any case , please save yourself the $ 10 and don't watch this movie .
  360|1|THE RATING SAYS ENOUGH
 3601|1|As bad as Leathal weapon 1 / 2 / 3 . . . . Dont know how they get away with making such crappy movies . . . . . . .
 3608|1|Josh Hartnett delivers a fun performance in this putrid , unfunny god-awful comedy . Ford is so mis-cast and wasted here .
 3615|1|i must admit , im a huge Arnold fan , Predator and Total Recall have to be 2 of the best action movies ever made ( of course total recall greatest sci fi film ever made ) . But folks , DONT SEE THIS . It is a disapointment to arnold and he knows it . It may have got 2 thumbs up but they were up their asses at the time . . . Dont bother with this one .
 3622|1|worst movie ever . not a shred of complexity , even with two dumb bodybuilding leads .
 3623|1|This movie could have done so much with its theme instead it just was the biggest let down - and I am an Arnold Schartzeneger fan . I hated it and everything about it , though I believe cloning is possible this movie went about it all in the wrong way .
 3644|1|poop
 3649|1|It seems times not the only thing this film ran out of
 3655|1|One word TERRIBLE . First , I don't much care for most Snipes flicks . They tend to all be about the same , and always predictable , and he always plays the same character . There are a few that are OK , but this isn't one of them . The special effects were bad , and one could tell that the budget was all spent on Snipes because the cars that blew up were always old cars off by themselves where the shots were easy to control . Avoid this film if you can .
 3661|1|CRAP
 3664|1|I thought nothing would beat Armageddon in stupidity . But I was wrong . Just watch this and you'll see for yourself . Actually don't . I dont think studios should get any $ for releasing this crap .
 3668|1|Samuel L Jackson : An excellent top-notch performer who wows audiences everywhere . Too bad he went so low by performing in this flick just used to get teens to come and see the wasted Vin Diesel . Good action scenes come few and far between . . . usually . There are none in this flick .
 3679|1|You see this and your very stupid WORSE MOVIE EVER ! ! !
 3682|1|Jackie , Jackie , Jackie . . . what on EARTH were you thinking ! ? ! He opted not to do his own stunts for this one , and it was a HUGE disappointment for many Jackie Chan fans . Storyline was lame , but I wasn't expecting Oscar material or anything . Jennifer Love Hewitt just wasn't convincing as a scientist . It was almost painful to watch , and if there are any Jackie Chan fans out there who hasn't seen this , I highly suggest that you spare yourself the pain !
 3687|1|It takes way too long for the adventure to begin .
 3691|1|Did not like this movie at all . It's a waste of time .
 3695|1|why must hollywood do this to the man that played vito corleone and jake la motta ?
 3697|1|Bad , bad and bad . You Pitt fans are better off staring at a poster . Julia Roberts fans need therapy anyway .
 3698|1|Very bad .
 3712|1|Wastes alot of talent . Bad plot . Samuel L Jackson will act in anything .
 3716|1|badbadbadbadbad . . . . Bad dialogue . Bad plot . BAD acting . Bad action . Not funny . Not even bad funny . ( no , I am not some English Patient loving snob-I like action movies - but this one blows )
 3725|1|This movie SUCKED . I laughed ( at the stupid acting , storyline , casting , and action scenes . ) , I cried ( because the damn movie just would never end . ) I fell asleep ( for obvious and aformentioned reasons . ) I saw this movie on prom night with all of my friends and maybe because we were all too busy making fun of it I really missed the whole point . . but I doubt it .
 3726|1|This movie was horrible . TCB , man . . . takin' care of bul * * hit in a flash . Kevin Costner was atrocious ( even for him ) . The writing was abysmal . Russel kind of looked like he'd rather be anywhere else than on this set . Awful movie .
 3729|1|This actually made my hair hurt ! Invest your ticket money in Budweiser and listen to the frogs .
 3738|1|Never saw it but Raiders of the Lost Ark should be number 1 .
 3743|1|I hate Martin Lawrence . I hate his comedy , I hate his movies and I hate the fact that he even has a career .
 3744|1|Who was the target audience for this , half-witted security guards ? I can't see anyone else thinking it was amusing .
 3757|1|Just an action movie to showcase the onscreen partnership of Ice Cube and Mike Epps . Not very good at all .
 3762|1|One Lame Movie !
 3764|1|UUUUUUUGGGGHHHHHH ! This movie was the most irresponsible , unwatchable , sorry excuse of a movie that was ever , I mean EVER , created . There was very little resemblence of a real NASCAR race or race team in this movie . It is the worst movie ever about NASCAR . Tom Cruise was wooden . The rest of the cast could barely hold their own . The script was unbelievable for any NASCAR fan . The action sequences were filmed during an actual running of the Daytona 500 . That is the entire highlight . Everything else is drivel .
 3766|1|Almost a precursor for " The Ghost Whisperer " , not as bad as the commercials led me to believe . Halle Berry plays a clinical psychologist who is wrongly imprisoned for a murder she didn't commit , and has to escape to clear her good ( and sexy ) name .
 3767|1|It had potential . Great actors , great story , and plot . They didn't use all of that to the best of their abilities . They let it fall very weak . Disappointing at best .
 3776|1|Driven . . . to the eject button .
 3780|1|one of the worst movies ever made
 3781|1|Dont ever expect a film WRITTEN BY STALLONE and directed by RENNY HARLIN to be anything of even slight interest . I enjoyed this movie the way I enjoyed Battlefield Earth , bad performances surrounded by mindlessly confusing direction . This movie equates roughly to poop on a stick
 3782|1|Best career move for Vin Diesal ; not being in a pointless sequel . Thge cars took center stage as usual because the plot was horrible . When you have a movie with Ludicris and Tyrese , what would you expect ?
 3783|1|I bet they got pretty deep into production of this movie before a intelligent passerby observed that " Faster and Furiouser " might not be the best name for the sequel .
 3787|1|Who actually liked this movie . Oh wait , people that own stupid slow ricer civics .
 3797|1|I thought it would be good but instead it was plain old horrible .
 3805|1|What's next , Ocean's Thirteen , Fourteen , etc . ? If you keep adding turkeys , maybe you can drive the Ocean series into the negative ratings .
 3806|1|Terribly boring , the first one was good and of course I thought this one wood be good . It just keep dragging out on and on . . . and on . Don't see this movie unless you have a severe case of insomnia and really need a good sleep .
 3810|1|I don't know why she gets roles when she produces efforts like this . The movie could've been saved if were about Caveziel's character .
 3813|1|There were a couple of moments where I thought the film could rebound and turn out to be halfway decent , but I was certainly wrong . I really don't see how it classifies as an action flick to begin with . It would be better suited under drama ( rated at the bottom of the list of course ) . The plot was hard to follow , and it's quite questionable as to whether there actually was one . A sappy love story with NO plot is never a good thing , and certainly never makes for a good action flick .
 3815|1|No chemistry between the actors , confusing plot an ending that made no sense . I left wondering what the whole thing was about feeling like I was ripped off .
 3816|1|Should have been called Mouseketeer . What a disappointment .
 3818|1|Only holywood can ruin a classic like that .
 3823|1|Gave it 10 minutes that is all I needed ! ! ! Don't bother ! ! ! I didn't need to see anymore to be able to tell that it sucked !
 3824|1|I like both Jolie and Banderas ( See Banderas in the 13th Warrior ! ) , but NOT in this movie ! While the film lamely tries to show a destructive relationship , the plot line is so preposterous that it does a disservice to both these budding stars . For your wallet's own good , skip this turkey .
 3825|1|Yea , this movie sucks . Directed by the same fool who got Jolie naked for the disastorous HBO film Gia comes a new film travisty which flonts the talents of an incredible actress and sheds her of clothes . Yeah , this movie was bad . But , one star above Tomb Raider ! ! !
 3827|1|These snake films are really bad . The snakes in this film get beefed up by chomping on the Blood Orchid . The film supposedly took place in Borneo . Anacondas are found in South America , not Borneo ! Martha made me go to this film ! Shame on her !
 3828|1|L . . . O . . . L ! From now on , the title Anaconda can only preceed a porno flick . These movies are terrible .
 3830|1|A friend and I got together and hacked this movie to absolute pieces . Anyone over 12 years old that thinks this film was worth 10 cents is delirious . This was an embarrassment and a poor effort to detail on the director's part . Way , way out there and far fetched ! Hand-to-hand combat while aboard a motorcycle going 100 mph , come on now ! The acting was poor and almost hilarious at times , even though this film was not supposed to be a comedy . Just an absolute waste of time . -1 star would be a gift for this nonsense !
 3836|1|Utter crap . I've seen better wrasslin' promos .
 3837|1|Wretched .
 3839|1|i hate steven seagal movies . he is a lousy actor with no personality
 3843|1|This garbage makes you root for the snake . Another J Lo piece of art .
 3844|1|One of the worst movies in the history of humanity .
 3845|1|Give me a break , the producer , the director and all the actors including the rubber snake should be banned from making movies for 50 years . They dont come any worse than this . . . . .
 3848|1|If you really want to see a movie about a giant snake that goes around killing people , well , first of all , why would you ? Second of all , this isn't the one . Bad effects , characters that you don't care whether they get eaten , etc .
 3849|1|Bad movie , horrible plot . DMX is one of the cases for why rappers shouldn't attempt to act . Jet Li didn't do some of the wire stuff like in " Romeo Must Die " . Just a horribly conceived and carried out plot .
 3851|1|JET LI STINKS .
 3852|1|how is this getting 2 stars ! ? Movies like this are why there should be a ZERO rating on this site ! What the hell was that , exactly ? Jet Li , fire your agent NOW ! ! ! DMX . . . . well , good for you , you got in another movie . Now go away .
 3856|1|HORRID action film with terrible performances and boring action scenes . Avoid at ALL costs .
 3862|1|one of the worst sequels done
 3864|1|I only saw 'Speed 2 : Cruise Control' once . Never have I been more disappointed at a sequel . Reviewer harold-insane said it right : What happened ? Well , I have three words to describe it : This blows chunks !
 3866|1|Two words , What happened ?
 3884|1|Rip off of a Japanese animation Kimba the white lion
 3948|1|It pisses my ass off .
 3956|1|Beauty and The Beast is one beast of a movie . It starts out really , really good but after one good musical numbers , 5 minutes have gone by and you are wondering , what the heck are we doing now . . . talking to teapots and candlesticks ?
 3972|1|This was a really annoying movie * just a spoonful of sugar * ugh .
 4110|1|A surprisingly dull movie with cheesy special effects , dull story line with dumb songs . I enjoyed the Roald Dahl's book but for some reason I hated this . Not even Gene Wilder could save this one ! Let's hope the new one with Johny Deep is way , way , way , way , way , way , way better !
 4208|1|yes
 4225|1|This is the worst movie EVER the stroy is DULL AND BORING summing it up this stroy was stupid !
 4268|1|Whistle While You Work ? How effin cheesy !
 4303|1|Highly predictable . Added nothing to the genre of Screen Animation . Tired old story with tired , old , uninteresting characters . Even Donkey couldn't make this piece of cinamatic tripe worth the money .
 4314|1|Man , do I hate this movie . Okay , so it was a little funny , but the story and voices were complete crap .
 4317|1|This is a boring , stupid , and easily predictible movie . Probably the worst movie I have ever seen .
 4342|1|For some reason I just didn't like this movie . It seems like it has too much adult humor . I mean , does a kid's movie really have to be laced with enough adult humor to require a PG rating ? Just because the parents want to be entertained while taking the kids to this ? If the parents want entertainment for themselves , hire a baby sitter and go out to see Bridget Jones Diary , but don't fill America's youth with foul humor even if it is 'sugarcoated' . Shrek was a dissapointment to say the least . The one good thing about it was the I'm a Believer remake , but again , that's for our own enjoyment , does a young child really care about Smashmouth or want a 'rock song' as their movie theme song ? I would hope that the answer , even in our jaded world is still no .
 4385|1|I really thought all the originality and humor from the original was gone . The story was basicly averege because it just had alot of the old shrek in it but with a Meet The Parents storyline which is very prdictable . The villians and the comical sidekicks are very dull since they have nothing funny to say . The only things funny things they say are coming from the voice actors instead of the script . Even the movie / pop refrences seemed out of place ! SEE the original instead !
 4408|1|both shrek's are way overrated , of all the pixar movies or whatever out there , this one is the worst . shrek is annoying , the donkey is annoying , the dumb cliche parodies are annoying .
 4420|1|I just want to know if the people that rated this movie good or great actually saw the movie . Because if you have you relize that this movie is quite horiible . True , it does take new steps in animation , but I would have to say that this movie is EXTREMELY BORING .
 4425|1|Chicken Run is a terrible clay-animated feature with the voices of Mel Gibson and Miranda Richardson . This movie is for the chickens .
  443|1|Horrendous dialogue and poorly crafted antagonists ; One of those occasions where the style-over-substance is a bad thing .
 4450|1|Horrible remake of a kids cartoon that needed no such treatment . It expanded the 'Grinch' universe . It just speaks to the arrogance of Hollywood . The notion that they could do something like this is appaulling That did not need doing either . Jim Carrey plays him ok , but not what it should have been . They should learn from their mistakes and not do things like this . Twenty-two minutes is just right for the Dr . Seuss classic .
 4459|1|Wow , I am really in a minority here ! But I really don't care . I feel this needs to be said . THIS FILM WAS TRASH ! I got it for Christmas and only watched it once . This was nothing at all like the cartoon . I can't believe they consider this a children's movie . Scenes of the Grinch eating the top off of a beer bottle , COME ON ! ! There is no way I can justify anyone allowing a small child to watch this film ! As far as I am concerned , Hollywood has once again butchered a classic .
 4483|1|They don't make kids films like they used to , thank god ! This was a stunning film . Stunningly and mind-numbingly bad . Excellent plot were a mere child finds a book and wrecks an entire movie . The key force of destruction in this movie is the Nothing , which is about all this trach is , nothing .
 4570|1|What I have to say will not earn a helpful rating from anyone , but I'll say it anyway : this movie was corny in places , stupid in other places , and it had violence . I couldn't find anything to like about it .
 4586|1|The fact that Airplane's Robert Hayes attracted me to rent this movie . I in fact learned a good lesson , that movies that show singing nuns are in fact way better then watching a cat drown .
 4598|1|The worst Harry Potter film yet . They skipped way too much of the book leaving loads if flaws . I also didn't like how this director changed Hogwarts so much . It looked nothing like the first two . I'm hope Globet of Fire will be a HUGE improvement !
 4617|1|Roald Dahl has written some great books , that were all turned into movies . First there was Willy Wonka , a pure classic . Then there was James and The Giant Peach , a great movie . Now comes Matilda , a piece of pure trash . I hated the girl in this movie . She is so annoying and such a weasel .
 4635|1|I remember when I watched this at school the kids made fun of the scene where the two main character sleep together . Sadly I think it's amusing since this film is mostly a snore .
 4641|1|Very stupid and boring movie !
 4657|1|Shockingly depressing and downbeat for a children's tale , this overrated pseudo-classic has crude animation , uninspired voice acting and little humor present .
 4670|1|Th most idiotic excuse for a movie I've seen in a while and I've seen some bad movies .
 4704|1|Note to Hollywood : Never bill celebrities on a theatre poster when they're only in the film for 5 minutes . Sigourney Weaver , Jon Voight , and Patricia Arquette star in this children's bore based on a hit novel of the same name . All three stars are wasted , with the exception of Voight who is given FAR too much screen time !
 4738|1|What an embarrassing movie ! Watching a little rat in cowboy boots , running a major coorperation in a small town inhabited by guniea pigs ? Terrible excuse .
 4779|1|Pocahontas is a 1995 disney film that is based upon the life of an indian woman a few hundred years ago and how her life changed when she became part of a man's life . It's as bad as it sounds , but worse . It is not what you'd expect from Disney , and it gets too boring and annoying .
 4796|1|3 words : Read the book ! Come on , it's only 70 pages or so . Charlotte's Web or Watership Down this movie is not ! Will be quickly forgotten .
 4802|1|Now , this is the type of film that caused Disney and I to part company until they redeemed themselves with the likes of The Lion King . I might have stayed loyal longer had they not insulted my intelligence with this kind of simplistic tripe . The Love Bug was one of several Disney films that came across as very one-dimensional , lacked wit , flare and was just silly . I know it was a big hit in its day but , in my case anyway , it just joined the ranks of the quickly produced , lame-o post-Walt stuff you too often found occasionally being churned out by Disney apparently for no other reason than to make a quick buck . And , with their moola , history and resources they had no real excuse for this kind of thing .
 4812|1|I love David Spade , but this movie was TERRIBLE . It is the worst movie Disney has ever made , with Hercules just slightly ahead . They tried too hard and it just didn't work .
 4828|1|THis is the worst movie I've ever seen ! ! ! The only part that was funny in the movie was when he sarcastically said that a leaf would attack him . I can't believed I wasted 12 bucks ( half for me and half for my date ) to see this movie ! ! Don't watch it unless your under 10 years old ! AY !
 4835|1|Swiss Family Robinson was the most boring Disney feature I have ever gone through in my life . It was a very bad experience watching this film , as it tried mixing The Sound Of Music with Gilligan's Island . Nope , it didn't work Walt .
 4836|1|Another Dreamworks animated diaster that just makes animation so they could compete with Disney when they are much worse . It's a Woody Allen comedy who makes loads of jokes for adults not any jokes for kids . The animation just plain sucks ( The ants looked liked aliens ) while the story is very long and boring . Skip it .
 4860|1|My opinion is that if Walt Disney had actually been frozen and he was brought back to life , he would see the dumb movies his company has made over the last few years and he would have a heart attack and die- again .
 4873|1|Quite simply , I hated this movie . Dustin Hoffman's scenery-chewing Captain Hook was annoying , and Robin Williams gets unintentional laughs as Peter Pan , running around in that ridiculous outfit . The lost boys are a bunch of little brats and heathens who need their behinds thrashed , and even Julia Roberts' usual charm wore thin as Tinkerbell . This is definitely one of Steven Spielberg's lesser efforts .
 4888|1|Wake me up when it's over .
 4898|1|It's horrible the animated version is awesome but , this is terrible imtatiaon THE ANIMATED VERSION RULES ! ! THIS ONE SUCKS ! !
 4943|1|This film is about as hilarious as Police Academy 5 . . . yes it's that bad . Two horrible performers wasted in a horrible film .
 4964|1|I want to say I enjoyed but I didn't it . Nearly fell asleep . I'm surprised I didn't . I was disappointd and I don't think this film has anything good about it . Unless your a 3D film fan , try to avoid . Summary : A BORING , STUPID FILM THAT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH GOOD ABOUT IT .
 4968|1|I was expecting a lot from this movie . The graphics were good , but the story was awful . It was slow , boring , and very pointless .
 4983|1|Okay , now this kind of film , even for kids , is a real insult to filmgoers everywhere . In spite of all its dynamic advertising and cool posters , it turned out to be nothing all that special , just a series of grotesque animal fights with dodgy CGI and tacky weapons . The fact that it tried to preach the theory that all cats are evil and that it's only thanks to the companionship of dogs that we're all happy and free didn't do it any favours . I like cats myself , and actually found it alarmingly offensive , particularly the portrayal of all 'cat people' as fat , drippy women and the horrific 'educational' cartoon of Ancient Egyptian history in which everything gets disgustingly distorted . But it couldn't even make the best of such a dubious concept . The script was poor and disappointingly slow-paced , with jokes I'd heard a thousand times before , the puppetry , particularly for the Chinese hairless , was pathetic , the plot was tissue-thin , and acting , both people and voices , was really , really bad . Only the trained cats and dogs gave it any life and soul . Little attempt was actually made to develop the characters , even the animal ones ( the least said about those irritating 'humans' the better ) . The plot ? A puppy with an adult voice is accidentally called upon to protect a scientist working on a cure for dog allergies from cats trying to take over the world . Very , very tedious . Your kids deserve better than this . If you're a dog lover , you'd probably be better off giving this a miss . If you're a cat lover , avoid it like hell !
 4989|1|I was suprised to see Cats and Dogs even make it to the top 300 here . It was just very boring and dull .
 4993|1|This movie had the potential to be very good . I thought it was great for the first three minutes . Then it turns out that cats and dogs are smarter than humans , and they use all of these James Bond type equipment to fight each other . It's so unreal that I wanted to hurl !
 4996|1|bad movie !
 5014|1|Looney tunes has been around for at least 50 years . Isn't it time to retire ?
 5029|1|Way too many adult jokes while the animation was pathetic . ( The Fish Looked like aliens ! ! ! ) Overall the worst animated film of the year and quite possibly the worst animated film I ever saw ! ! !
 5039|1|Hate it ! There's no songs to sing along .
 5056|1|I wasted 7 f * * king dollars seeing this movie in theaters ! ! ! !
 5057|1|TOO BAD I CAN'T GIVE IT A ZERO OR LOWER ! ! ! I HATE SPONGEBOB ! ! ! DUMBEST CHARACTER EVER ! ! !
 5070|1|worse movie ever
 5093|1|Is it possible to ruin a great franchise with a single stroke . History has taught us so and this is a classic case of that phenomenon . When you start adding new and horrible characters like Dil things start rolling down hill pretty fast . This makes another franchise Nikelodeon has totally ruined by putting it on the big screen .
 5117|1|the epitimy of stupid
 5136|1|It was awful they put that brat Jane In there I love Wendy she is sweet but , I hate jane ( yuck ) then they replaced the cool crocodile with a stupid squid and the story was stupid but , I LOVE the original Peter Pan it's awesome in fact the original one is one of my favorite movies but this Cheapquel stinks ! ! !
 5148|1|I can remember seeing The Borrowers in the movie theaters when it came out , and I didn't want to see it , but my friend dragged me out to it . I hated this movie . It was so god-awful and John Goodman's character was so annoying .
 5149|1|W-O-R-S-E M-O-V-I-E E-V-E-R ! ! ! DON'T SEE THIS CRAPFEST ! ! ! SO BOOOOORING
 5154|1|not a good movie . too much like tha first one !
 5156|1|Who in the right mind would watch this movie ? It could bore you to tears worse than Margaret Atwood .
 5166|1|I hope it isn't bad as most DTV ( direct to video ) Disney releases .
 5170|1|Beyond stupid , I regret taking my kids to see this lame movie . Disney can do better than this !
 5172|1|Very fake , even for a kids movie . What professional basketball player drives a Buick Park Avenue ? Obviously underfunded , all basketball players have Escalades .
 5173|1|Hey Li'l Bow Wow : give it up .
 5174|1|This was the worst basketball movie since The Air Up There .
 5182|1|Eddie Murphy stars in the big screen release of a popular Disney ride . What works for the 'Pirates' does not work for this movie . Jennifer Tilly has it in her contract that she must be the voice if they ever rework the ride .
 5188|1|And the world needed another Rugrats Movie because . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
 5199|1|Disgraceful . Dr . Seuss should rise from the dead and strangle Mike Myers .
 5206|1|Corny and pointless . How matt LeBlanc starred with one and the movie saw release is beyond me .
 5208|1|I respect anyone who has had the guts to make as many come backs as the Olsens have , but I am just not into their new stuff .
 5211|1|no go
 5216|1|Not again !
 5218|1|I actually like some of the Pokemon movies and recently I was very dissapointed in Yu-Gi-Oh the movie DAMNIT 4kids entertainment . WHY DIDNT YOU LEAVE YU-GI-OH THE WAY IT WAS . Anyway I don't like digimon to begin with and so I don't like this movie . It just sucks and it really is a Pokemon except without decent animation and at least some entertainment . The Digimon Movie is so bad it should'nt even have a rating . But I cant not give it a rating so I'll be nice and give it a 1 .
 5220|1|Digimon is exactly like pokemon
 5221|1|i liked it the first time when it was called pokemon the movie . . . . . . oh , wait , no i didn't .
 5222|1|It sucks ! A wannabe pokemon movie .
 5223|1|Mindless crap
 5225|1|Digimon : The Movie may be the worst experience in a movie theater or in your own house that you have ever experienced in your life . You cant make a movie out of these stupid japensese cartoon guys , and it is just so boring and tasteless , and mindless .
 5266|1|biggest load of s * & t I've ever had the misfortune to see in my entire life
 5291|1|Doesnt make the grade . This move is unsuitable for little children yet too childish for adults . The troupe is knocked out by poppies . An educated person can tell that poppies are the producers of opium . So it implies that these heroes are really druggies . These loveable charecters whom children want to be like influence them to do things the majority of them might not have done if this movie was not shown to them .
 5295|1|Even as a child , I hated this movie . It was so dull and predictable .
 5320|1|Dorothy is boring . This movie really ruined the excellent children's books by L . Frank Baum . The direction was sloppy and the message was preachy . Housewives , bring 2 martinis and a tub of olives to make this bastardization of children's literature go down better .
 5326|1|This is one of the worst books I have read . I am against racism , and this book is all about it . I have a copy of the book that also has very tiny print , so you have to watch what / when you bought the book , as the words are so small , it's almost impossible to read .
 5339|1|I thought the book was great because of all of the adventures scout and her friends had . Another reason why it was good is because it was deep into details
 5345|1|The movie and the book are two different things . The book was told from one perspective , and the movie from another . The book gave specific details about the characters , the movie didn't give anything but the name of the character . Some of the scenes in the movie did happen in the book , but most of the major scenes from the book never made it into the movie .
 5386|1|Purely overrated . Some good elements , but the ending is so pathetic . As if everyone in the town would pitch in money for a disliked unpopular person .
 5390|1|Maudlin crap . Capra's worst film .
 5406|1|BORING ! ! !
  554|1|who let this get so high up the list ?
 5544|1|Amazing how this movie holds up . The atmosphere alone makes it a must see . Alfred was in top form on this one . A true classic .
 5592|1|
 5672|1|Other then Titanic this is the most overated movie of all time . Talk about stating the obvious , Tomorrow is another day . Give me a break , the dialogue is terrible and the story is week . If the book was published today it would be one of those trashy novels that women read .
 5675|1|I tried , I really tried . . . it's too dated . Unwatchable . I'LL NEVER GO HUNGRY AGAIN ! Yikes .
 5676|1|Frankly my dear I do not give a damn about this movie .
 5677|1|I have never understood why people like this trash . It's melodramatic , unbelievable , fantasized , etc . If people liked it for those reasons that would be understandable--just a matter of personal taste . However , they describe it as if it were some great example of fine acting . Phooey ! I put it in the same category as Birth of a Nation . Romanticized racist drivel .
 5681|1|If you have trouble falling asleep then I prefer Gone With the Wind . Someone pretty much made me watch this . . . and every time I think of this film I start to get a little sleepy ! ! ! Why people rate this high is beyond me . . . that is obviously their own opinion , but WOW . . . snooze fest if I ever seen one ! ! !
  570|1|i hate these kind of movies
 5701|1|Gone with The Wind has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life . Words can not describe my disappointment with this movie , especially after hearing so much hype as to how wonderful the movie was and etc . I guess when the movie debut in 1939- it was a great movie for the time . However , by today's standards , this movie is nothing but trash . I could not help but to laughed through most of the movie because the acting was so bad . I kind of feel sorry for the people who remember when Gone with The Wind was considered a great movie- it clearly shows how far the United States of America has come since the dark ages of the oppressive South .
  572|1|I couldnt even sit all the way through this clunker , so maybe my opinion isnt that valid . The movie just doesnt work , I found it unwatchable
 5764|1|2 WORDS SHE SUCKED AND SHE'S UGLY
 5788|1|Rediculous- Fonda makes himself both defense attorney and witness during deliberations- Politicak Correct Claptrap
 5807|1|12 Angry Men made me sick .
 5812|1|Sorry , but I found it long and boring . Maybe it's because I expected too much . As long as I can remember , I've heard and read about what a great picture this is . ( Rated # 1 by the National Film Institute ) . When I compare Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) and Casablanca ( 1942 ) its like night and day . The storyline , acting and cinematography in Casablanca are vastly superb to Kane .
 5829|1|I'm sorry , but it's about a sled . Named Rosebud . Maybe I missed something , but I didn't like it at all . I think it's overrated .
 5831|1|I've tried , really tried , to get into this movie . I've never been able to make it half-way through it . Maybe I need to stick it out and watch the whole movie , I don't know . From what I have seen of this movie , I just don't know what the big deal is . Maybe one of you can enlighten me . . .
 5849|1|NO ONE WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN HE SAID HIS LAST WORDS
 6004|1|This is a really , really , really bad movie . It amazes me that this flick has the following it does . . . . the writing is pathetic and the acting not much better . . . . a good money maker in its day but a lousy picture all round .
 6019|1|I thought this movie was so boring it lacked substance and character
 6033|1|Dr . Strangelove is an extremly boring and dull movie that was unimaginativly made , and Peter Sellers makes a total fool of himself . It's extremly dark and gothic , and it's just totally stupid .
 6066|1|WOW . If you are not gay , this movie is not your cup of tea . The fruity dancing basketball players ? The fruity street fight dance ? Unwatchable .
 6181|1|I hated this movie because of Mickey Rooney's performance . He was terrible , honestly . He donned coke-bottle glasses and buck teeth to play a Japanese guy . How mean can Rooney be ? Seriously , Being asian is not a crime . And Audrey Hepburn , She didn't seem to pack much talent . She was more of the looks type . She was famous because she packed visually , not talent .
 6189|1|if you look into the movie its about a slutty girl who sells her body for the slightest things such as feeding her cat . She befriends a gigalo and then they fall in love . Overall this movie sucked and i would sincerely reccomend not seeing it .
 6230|1|I agree with the squeamish feeling , this movie offends any person with knowledge of actual history . The only person who could enjoy this movie would be somebody who could enjoy Nazi propaganda from World War II . It is that objectionable and disgusting .
 6231|1|I know I should be critical of the film for it's cinematic value as well as historic place in cinema but . . . I can't get through it . It offends my squeamish bone .
 6250|1|Even worse than Ben-Hur . A waste of film and an embarassment to anyone remotely associated with this abortion .
 6293|1|Although the movie is nearly devoid of objectionable content ( aside from the occasional profanity ) , there are two things that absolutely destroy the movie . First , the songs are extremely grating and annoying . Second , the sexism in this production is outrageous . No more is this obvious than the shockingly-inappropirate ending . The ending is completely different than the short story , Pygmmalion , that this 1964 movie is based on . I just can't recommend this production .
 6510|1|One of Kubrick's less known films about the absurdity of war , specifically the French suicide attacks during the trench fighting of WWI . Based on actual events this is a very powerful anti-war film .
 6558|1|Typical James Dean boring stuff , not to mention the cigs . . . . . . .
 6571|1|The title says it all . The characters have no motives or personality .
 6609|1|Fiddler on the Roof is really , really lame .
 6617|1|This movie should have been about 30 mins long . How much motorcycle riding does one movie need . The characters don't have any real mission , they just ride . I have never fallen asleep during a movie before , but I was dangerously close watching this one . Beyond a shadow of a doubt , one of the top ten WORST movies I've ever seen . I agree with Flano , the sixties summed up in a movie , it's trash .
 6678|1|Went to the movies to watch this and couldn't see a thing , what a waste of money ! ! ! !
 6725|1|Another classic awful movie with James Dean , thankful that he only made three movies , boring stuff with cigs . . . .
 6791|1|Monty Python is boring . Just another famouse name which is meant to make me think 'This is going to be a good movie . '
 6792|1|I know I'm going to get killed for this but Is it possible to hate this movie . Because I do . All the jokes were way too over-the-top to be funny . The funniest stuff you couldn't understand because of their British accents and the ending didn't make much sense . If you want funny comedies watch Airplane , Naked Gun movies , Pink Panther movies and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit . I'm not kidding I didn't enjoy this film . But the credits before the film was funny .
 6808|1|I thought this was the TBN cast doing another telethon .
 6835|1|not funny
 6837|1|I sure am in the minority here but I could never laugh at this !
 6840|1|All I can say is I hate this movie and can't believe you all thought it was good enough to rate first .
 6882|1|This movie absolutly SUCKED !
 6918|1|Ignorant , lowest common denominator crap . I knew better jokes when I was in Grade 5 .
 6922|1|Punny . Gets old after a while .
  701|1|It is an old man's film , I think this because my Dad watches it over and over and its so boring ! does he have any taste ?
 7108|1|It was corny [ beans make you fart - come on ! ] Is this funny ?
 7124|1|This movie had one funny scene . I thought this war REALLY overrated .
 7133|1|Blazing Saddles is the last spoof you'd want to have on your wish list . It is never , ever funny , and is an embarrassment to Mel Brooks , who really tried his best to spoof westerns , but this movie is totally dull and boring . The characters are introduced to the film , and then dropped from the script and not heard from again .
 7160|1|I seldom walk out of movies , but in this case I made an exception .
 7201|1|National Lampoon movies are very rarely ever good . They resort to lowbrow humor which send many running from their VCR ( I could never see a dumb movie like this making it to DVD ) . The acting stink and the jokes smell worse . Go away , bad movie !
 7257|1|Total crap .
 7258|1|Don't understand the appeal of this one .
 7279|1|That whole scene with the feces floating in the pool really grossed me out ! And why the hell would a guy eat it ? Sorry , but when I was done with this scene , I almost threw up . Even if it was supposedly just a baby ruth .
 7288|1|Bill Murray always manages to come up with new holidays for morons . This was one of the bottom ten worst movies I have ever managed to sit through . Absolutely and completely stupid !
  733|1|Just dreadful . But what else could it be , having that awful book as a basis .
 7340|1|Yet another R-rated horror , this time set in an office , this one is also filled to the brim with bad acting , boring execution and gobs of objectionable content . There are over 80 uses of profanity , and again , for reasons I can begin to fathom , the most often used one is the worst one , the f-word . There is also sexual content ( although not nearly as much as the worthless American Pie or the brain-dead Martin Lawrence : RunTelDat . And , of course , drug use and alcohol is present . But , what else would you expect from the writers of the stupid Beavis Butt-Head series on the network for brain-deads , MTV . Stay out of this office and run to a certain Federation starship , catch some Pokemon , or let it snow !
 7357|1|Pretty bad .
 7365|1|Any movie with Ben Stiller as the lead is in dire trouble . He plays the same tired charactor in everything he does . No variation . I LOATHE Ben Stiller .
 7367|1|f * * king idiotic .
 7370|1|I'm the black sheep here - I didn't think the movie was funny . No real man would have ever put up with that kind of crap . . . ( okay , the sex-toys in the suitcase thing was kind of funny )
 7450|1|simply not funny . poorly directed . SQUANDERED DE NIRO . i don't see what all the fuss is about .
 7452|1|I dont know why everyone likes this movie it is bad . It isnt even that funny . Robert Deniro i dont know what you were thinking when you agreed to do this movie . dont see it is bad . And i hoe that the sequil is called meet the faukers
 7467|1|I thought that Meet the Parents was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I didn't care about the characters at all . We never got to fully understand Ben his fiance's relationship , therefore not caring whether they got through this obstacle of meeting her parents . It wasn't funny . I was so bored and annoyed with the movie , I was actually looking away from the screen . I understand how nerve racking it is meeting significant others parents , but this was just too ridiculous . I do have a sense of humor and I do like stupid entertaining movies but this was just stupid . I thought it was horrible . The movie was so predictable so it took away from the funny parts since you knew what was coming up . I thought Ben Stiller was good . His fiance was not . Robert DeNiro used to be great , he was okay in this movie . This movie just rubbed me the wrong way and I ended up walking out with 15 minutes left . Didn't I want to see whether they get back together ? Well , no . I didn't care at all . I also knew that they would since the movie was so predictable . I thought about it after I walked out to see if I was too harsh . . . . but I really didn't like the movie .
 7493|1|Fred Gwynee of the legendary TV-G comedy series , The Munsters was in this piece of useless junk ? Forget it . R is another underrate and it is NOT funny . Go see Ice Age , Pokemon4Ever or Star Trek : Nemesis instead .
 7507|1|What a train wreck ! Coming after the brilliant Animal House I expected greatness , but OY ! Hackneyed , stupid schlock .
 7521|1|The Blues Brothers is not a musical . . . . not a comedy . . . not a classic . . . . it's a crap ! This movie is extremly long and tired . It's never , ever funny and Belushi and Akroyd can't act in this . It's like their scripts were written by monkeys on roller skates or something . Avoid at all costs !
 7534|1|stupid
 7551|1|I tend to enjoy British comedy , but this really sucks .
 7553|1|And I thought Holy Grail was bad . Really unfunny .
 7560|1|Holy Grail was way better .
 7566|1|Marking a sad turn in the Python franchise , from PG to the R rating . Believe me , the really bad profanities are nowhere near as brilliant as the fish-slapping dance of saying Ni ! Avoid this one and stick with their older stuff instead .
 7607|1|what a joke . this was the stupidest movie with the worst music . Clooney is good at picking the worst movies to act in .
  761|1|Uh-uh . Not scary .
 7620|1|Incredibly poor attempt at mirroring Homer's great work the Odyssey . This movie could not have gotten more boring .
  766|1|Like most of M . Night Shalyman's films , boring , predictable , and unscary . It had me wondering how anyone would waste their hard earned cash on dreck like this . Bruce Willis gives his usuall less than steller preformance . How he is considered by some to be a great actor is beyond me . The one bright spot was the acting of Hayley Joel Osmet , who has a great future in pictures if he can avoid clunkers like this one .
 7662|1|rubbish
 7670|1|Mike Myers is about as funny as a stucco bathtub . This movie is less humourous than that .
 7671|1|I'm almost afraid to rate this so low considering its widespread popularity , but I absolutely hate it . I find the supposed'humor' to be crude , disgusting and not funny at all . The characters are obnoxious and make the whole movie going experience painful .
 7672|1|I can't remember even smiling at this movie once .
 7674|1|TOO CORNY FOR ME .
  768|1|Takes to long . Boring
 7680|1|Totally unfunny movie that had perhaps two decent scenes in it . This garbage is best suited for the mental retards who think Adam Sandler and the other imbecile , Jim Carry are a hoot . George W . loves this movie , which tells you alot . The only saving grace of this film was the art direction . As for the rest , pure dreck .
 7683|1|I hated this movie . Thats right . I HATED it . Austin Powers is the most annoying person I've ever met . There is no humor is this trash at all- and some of you said that Maury was garbage ! If Maury is trash , what the hell is this stuff ? !
 7688|1|I just don't get it .
 7693|1|This movie was actually more retarded than I had expected . The scene with the coconuts and Hurleys tits was like HUH , are you fugging serious ! SOUTH PARK is 1000 times more stupid and crude and funny than this piece of dumbsh * t . In fact , Mike Myers is only funny in SNL . HyperHypo , Man . Now thats funny , harharharhar . . . . . youpatheticfools .
 7696|1|Really stupid film , not funny at all .
 7699|1|From what I'd heard this movie was par to Monty Python . So I rented it . All I remember about it was waking up to drool all over my nice new leather couch .
 7704|1|I couldn't sit through more than 5 minutes of this .
 7706|1|I'd prefer to give a negative 1 star if it were possible . I didn't enjoy this movie , didn't find it funny , and could have found something better to do with my time . this movie was just plain STUPID
 7713|1|It was horrible . It was very perverted and kids should not watch it . It was meaningless .
  772|1|Predictable !
 7739|1|This is a comedy ? I can't believe people rated it this high - not funny to me .
 7743|1|not funny ! ! !
 7746|1|Dr . Strangelove or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb is one of the best titles I've ever heard of . While the movie is one of the most unfunny , unimaginative pieces of trash I've ever seen . The movie is extremly dark and gothic . I really felt umcomfortable watching it .
 7784|1|I really don't think Adam Sandler's that funny . He's too slapstick ! Gimme Shaun Micallef any day - he's got wit , not just silly voices .
  779|1|Predictable !
 7817|1|I can't believe this was such a success ! I am proud to say that I actualy stayed awake through half of the film . Not what I expected from the team of Mathau and Lemon ; The Odd Couple films were hilarious . But don't buy the hype people ! Very boring movie !
 7837|1|As good as it gets is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen ! ! ! I love Greg Kinnear , Cuba Gooding , Jr . and Helen Hunt , so I was extremely disapointed that this lame attempt at comedy with a heart was just so . . . bad . As good as her acting was in this movie , are we actually to believe that someone like Helen Hunt would fall in love with Jack Nickolson ? ? ? Ha ! Yeah , right ! ! !
 7839|1|I will say this once . . I HATE HELEN HUNT !
 7856|1|Not really a fan of this movie . I prefer classic Nicholson flicks like The Shining . This movie was pretty lame-o , a real Munson , a real steaming piece of crap , a real loser .
 7859|1|Could that movie have been just a little longer ? I wasn't bored quite long enough .
 7872|1|I will never understand why anyone has anything good to say about this movie . I walked out of the theatre amazed at the crap I had just seen . I couldn't connect the good reviews to what I had just witnessed . Go figure .
 7909|1|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen . I never understood its popularity . Might appeal to 5th graders , or adults with zero sophistication .
 8016|1|Unfunny and unwatchable Bill Murray vehicle , with bad screenplay and confusing plot .
 8026|1|Not funny . . . needed more work
 8046|1|My mom forced me to watch this . I was so bored , I fell asleep . Nothing really happens . I didn't get more than 1 laugh in .
 8052|1|I don , t know what all the good press was about ! This movie was boring and definetly not funny !
 8087|1|What do people see in this movie . It is not funny . There is little or no plot the acting is poor , there is just nothing good about it .
 8095|1|Watching this movie is like eating bad breath . Terrible terrible terrible movie . Even mean girls is better , and that hurts to say . . . but boobies beat ass-crack any day . don't see this movie
 8101|1|Terrible movie that deserves no awards .
 8116|1|Making fun of Chinese and Black people does not make a good movie !
 8141|1|the only thing i lied was jim
 8146|1|Any Jim Carey movie is totally predictable and boring .
 8154|1|This movie is so damn weak . I don't know if Disney is affiliated with this piece of garbage . But if they aren't , they should be . The premise for this movie is pretty childish , and the courtroom scenes are pathetic . Jim Carrey should stick to doing movies like Dumb and Dumber and the Cable Guy .
 8200|1|Errol and I have had some differences , but I will fully back him up on this . What a trashy film .
 8203|1|Here's another crude terror from the evil brothers named Farrelly . Sadly , this started the slide of sewage that are teen comedies now-a-days and it only has one purpose : to gross-out . Let's just say , aside from the fact it has constant profanity , I cannot site examples as to why it is so bad except to say they are extremely sexually suggestive .
 8206|1|When humor this crude and mean-spirited is considered one of the greatest comedies ever by so many people , I am convinced that our society has pretty much totally lost it .
 8217|1|There's nothing worth a damn about Mary .
 8230|1|I rented this movie after hearing all the hype about it . This was the worst movie I have ever seen . I may have chuckled once , but good dramas usually put more amusing lines in a film . Truly horrible !
 8235|1|This movie , although many thought it was very funny , I felt it was stupid and Ben Stiller is incredibly annoying .
 8241|1|disappointing
 8266|1|ok i am the only one i think from what i glanced at that hated this movie . : ( sorry : ( i really have no opinion i just didnt like it for some reason .
  827|1|I admit that this is a very good movie , but I gave it one star because IT IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE ! ! ! !
 8270|1|This movie sucked . O Brother Where Art Thou ? , now that's a funny movie .
 8301|1|What a dog ( ma ) of a movie . yuck .
 8303|1|Sacreligious . Some things are sacred and shouldn't be poked fun at . I'm down for laughing at almost everything , but not my beliefs .
  831|1|Well I guess I'm in the minority here but I thought the movie was terrible and boring to boot ! ! Sure the premise of being able to see dead people is spooky and all but somewhere in there people seem to have gotten so swept up by the whole idea of it that they forgot how corny so much of it was with Bruce Willis walking around the city trying to sort out this little kids ( and his own ) problems . C'mon people work with me here . It was more of a drama than a horror movie . Oh no there's a pastey faced girl under my bed and she wants me to go deliver a box to Mommy and Daddy ! ! ! ! Oooohhhh . Now don't get me wrong if I found a pastey faced girl in a nightie hiding out under my bed you can bet I'd freak to the extreme but one things for sure you wouldn't catch me running errands for her . oh and while your out if you would be so kind as to stop off at mummy and daddys to drop of a little something for me I'd be ever so indebted to you
 8319|1|stupid movie .
  833|1|a super one time movie , but it's not one of those repeated viewing movies , which is important when rating it overall . Won't stand the test of time , trust me !
 8340|1|An absolutely dreadful film , not because of its blasphemous contents but rather because it was so juvenile and such a mish-mash of oddments thrown together . and did anyone notice how the guy who didn't speak copied all of his facial expressions from joey in friends ! !
 8426|1|I really enjoyed the first one but as much as I like Austin Powers I hated 2 . It was not really very funny with a lot of bathroom humor , more so than the first . One spy spoof was enough Mike look for some thing new . I have not seen 3 yet but it looked about the same stuff re-hashed . Update : I have seen 3 and I was right .
 8431|1|Somebody put this movie out of it's misery . Just a thought .
 8433|1|Dreadful . Even worse than the first one .
 8439|1|IT WAS KIND OF CORNY , AND NASTY .
 8445|1|I really , really , really hate it when bad movies get a sequel and good ones don't . Austin Powers is a fool and so are the writers of this lowbrow , moronic comedy . I don't understand the appeal of this movie . The jokes are gross and what I call under-the-top , which means the situation is not played up for comedy in a clean way and resorts to the garbage can instead . Don't watch it .
 8446|1|This one was just as bad as the horrible first one .
 8451|1|if i could i would get all the austin powers 2 vhs and dvd videos over at my house , take them out back and take a fat dump on all of them .
 8462|1|don't bother - # 1 was bad enough .
 8487|1|I went to see this movie with high enthusiasm and was quite let down . It was not worth spending $ 8 on . The same jokes as the original movie were used , most times less effectively than the first Austin Powers . The new characters , mainly Fat Bastard , served for a few laughs , but overall , it's NOT a must see .
 8497|1|So bad it is good ? I don't see the attraction to this movie . The acting was terrible , the story is barely a story . I heard people describe the dialog as brilliant , personally it felt like a teenager wrote the script , hopping from topic to disjoint topic that keeps the overall story moving , wading knee-deep in circles and ultimately going absolutely nowhere .
 8498|1|What kind of drivel is this ? It doesn't bother me that it is black and white , because some of my favorite movies ( Bringing Up Baby , Aresnic and Old Lace ) are black and white . What does bother me is the complete and utter lack of talent and creativity found in this overrated film . The entire setting and situation is wholly uncreative . A gas station ? Good grief . Also the dialogue is peppered with mean-natured scatalogical jokes and the foulest of words . Kevin Smith should have never gotten into business .
 8506|1|A plotless film- I generally have nothing against plotless films , in fact I've enjoyed a whole lot of them . But this one just made me sick . Atrocious acting . Parts were funny , but I did NOT enjoy Clerks .
 8517|1|Low budget is one thing . Low concept is another . Where was the comedy ? I wish I could have given it zero stars .
 8518|1|Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen . Kevin Smith must have sold his soul to the devil to have a career . What a hack .
 8538|1|Obnoxious chick flick . I hope Meg Ryan's next flight crashes in a cannibal country .
 8575|1|This movie was horrible . It was not funny at all . Everyone that I've ever talked to also say it was horrible . his is one of Sandra Bullock's worst performanes . I think she was on her last two legs with this movie , and they just got cut off . A real sleeper . Expect anything but entertainment from this horrid film
 8589|1|WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE . PEOPLE SHOULD SUIT .
 8594|1|DUH ! It gets two stars for the wisdom of using Candice Bergen and loses one of them for wasting her .
 8618|1|Adam Sandler sucks !
 8626|1|Adam Sandler can't act . Would someone mind telling me why he stars in so many movies ?
 8644|1|It was watchable but that was about it and I can only take Charles Grodin in small amounts .
 8645|1|This has got to be one of the stupidest , most unfunny piece or tripe I have ever seen . Grodin and De Niro whould have known better than to make a turkey like this one . When I see it scheduled on TV , I find something else to do , so I won't turn on the tv and accidently see this assinine movie . I absolutly hate it .
 8665|1|From what I've heard and seen of the movie , it is one of those teenaged movies which is based on sex . That movie is a lot of garbage because it is crude , sends a signal to young people that popularity is what to live for and sex is a cheap and dirty thing , plus it tells young people that swaring is cool . I remember there used to be an old song called American Pie and it was a very good song which even glorified God . It is amazing how sin can stuff things up . Sex when used properly , is a very sweet , clean , good thing which signifies spiritual and physical bondage between husband and wife . It is not to be used out of marriage or anything other then husband or wife .
 8725|1|a really bad un-funny movie , a couple of cute scenes does not make a good comedy !
 8726|1|I love crude , obnoxious teen sex movies , but , only when they're funny . This one fails terribly .
 8727|1|the MOST non humorous comedy ever ! ! ! this movie sux . Some teen comedys are pretty funny and captures high school shenanigans , this one does NOT ! ! Terrible cast aside from the father .
 8731|1|Only in the US could you think this passes for humor ( sic )
 8740|1|I thought this movie was derivative and not funny at all .
 8754|1|This movie was HORRIBLE ! ! ! Drew's character Lucy had to live the SAME day over and over until she died ! ! ! Also , the movie was more about that than her relationship with Adam Sandler ! ! ! What was Drew thinking by making this GODAWFUL film ! ! ! " Doppelganger-The Evil Within " was BETTER than this SLOP ! ! ! Hasn't Drew been torchered ENOUGH ? ! ! ! Those of you who haven't seen this film , but want to ; take my advice : DON'T ! ! ! ! See " The Wedding Singer " INSTEAD ! ! ! 'Cause believe me , it's a MUCH better film than this one ! ! !
 8775|1|I dont know whats happening to Adam Sandler .
 8783|1|Dry boring humor . I walked out on this one .
 8796|1|This is one of those movies that when you are leaving the theatre you hope your not reckognized . This movie sucked ! I have been a dog owner and I like dogs . But sitting down and watching a bunch of eccentric freaks parade their dogs made me sick . This was not a comedy it was a tragedy . This group of dogs gets treated better than most humans .
 8811|1|How can they call this a comedy ? I don't think I laughed one time . Sure Wayne and Garth were funny on SNL but the movie is horrible .
 8829|1|This is the worst movie ever made ! Only stoners like this movie . If I could have one movie erased from history , this would be the one ! ( and I've seen all Pauly Shore's movies )
 8847|1|Yet another cardboard cut-out , let's go smoke pot and get high , teenage sex , humorless flick . This movie was not at all entertaining and wasn't worth the price of the rental .
 8875|1|Another total waste of space from America's most popular pot smoking duo . . . a completely idiotic movie in every way . . . no point whatsoever . . . do not waste your hard earned money buying this junk . . .
 8878|1|Drugs aren't funny unless the morons using them get arrested !
  891|1|This was a really sorry movie . Huh ? What's the point ? A total waste of my time . I thought the movie was going to be scary , but it wasn't . The Blair Witch was a lot better .
 8913|1|This movie is just a rip off of an old French film called Le Cauge Aux Follies .
 8959|1|this was junk . it was not funny at all . and there were alot of boring parts . this was not one of Jim Carreys good movies .
 8962|1|Jim Carey is not a good actor , and this movie is unadulterated trash . The plot is pointless and full of childish one liners and simple comedy for simple minded folks . Morgan Freeman as God is one of the few bright points in this banal piece of trash .
 8981|1|Mediocre at best . A weak performance by Jim Carey punctuated by a nauseating shift to an even weaker morality play . Who among us could feel sorry for a guy who had a great job and life in the first place . Give me a camera and mike and off I go in an instant to shoot public interest stories .
 8983|1|What are people saying about this movie ? It was soooo bad ! Somebody commented to me later that it was the first movie he's seen whose trailer explains the entire movie . He's totally right . Save yourself $ 9 . 00 and just watch the trailer . There were , maybe , 2 funny scenes . Terrible , terrible .
 8995|1|Chevy isn't funny in any disguise .
 9007|1|Best Picture in 1977 over Star Wars . That's sickening to think about . That just proves that the Academy voters were all a bunch of short nerdy idiots .
 9043|1|HAted it ! Chris Farley is a poor replacement for John Candy and Jim Belushi , and this movie proves it . David Spade whould be expelled from Hollywood , as his act is getting way to old .
 9063|1|That John Belushi wannabe Chris Farley couldn't be funny even if he were a ten foot Pole ! And this film is no exception . As usual , Chris Farley tries too hard . He's not a natural at anything except attempting self-exploitation . . . May he RIP , his career will last longer as a legend than it would've had he lived .
 9076|1|Ouch , my skin is crawling . If you know anything about the prostitution business you will find this extremely offensive . Theresa Russell , who is about 100 times as attractive as Roberts , was incensed by this movie and made Whore in 1991 to show the true side of prostitution .
 9077|1|Only thing funny about it is that they call it a comedy . I didn't find it the least bit funny . Oh well .
 9082|1|An unfunny piece of garbage . Hardly a comedy .
 9085|1|Pretty boring , unfunny and contrived , you mean .
 9088|1|One of the worst films of all time . Ridiculous plot , assinine premise . Julia Roberts is the most unconvincing actress to come along in decades and Richard Gere , not surprisingly , acts like he's got a weasel shoved up his rectum . A predictable , unentertaining and totally unrealistic piece of crap .
 9113|1|I don't know why this movie was such a big hit , it was gay .
 9139|1|This one's a stinker . Taking steps away from the PG-rated Holy Grail and the TV-PG Flying Circus series , this one has horrible sight gags and just tons of sick stuff . Avoid at all costs . I'll take the Knights of Ni and the Fish Slapping Dance over this dreck any day .
 9142|1|BOOOOO !
 9153|1|I did not think I would like this movie and I was right . Totally pointless and why did they pick on John Malkovich who really was not that interesting . If it comes on TV some night give it a look but don't invest any money in it .
 9157|1|Basically , it S-U-C-K-E-D . . .
 9158|1|Another stupid movie . Avoid .
 9163|1|this movie is no even funny
 9169|1|Awful
 9172|1|is there a half star that wuz the worst show i have seen period i'm not showing any sarcasm either that show wuz so utterly boring i would litterally die before watching it again i saw no funny things or no high points it wuz so boring i didn't even watch it all . worse then battlefield earth not joking either
 9207|1|Why do they continue to let hugh grant and sandra bullock refer to themselves as actors ?
 9216|1|Never heard of this movie ? No wonder . . it was one of the lowest rated movies of all time . Don't bother watching or wasting your money
 9229|1|Adam Sandler sucks !
 9292|1|Another very over rated movie , Lili Dolly and Jane . This was Dolly's first feature and she was the best two parts of the movie . I have never found Lili to be all that funny and Jane well Jane is never funny . Dabney Coleman suffers through the abuse that the ladies force upon him and the movies brings some short lived life to his carier . Good vehicle to get Dolly started up other then that it was a bust ! Ouch .
 9304|1|This was sopposed to be a comedy movie ? You gotta be kidding me-it sucked !
 9333|1|I dislike this movie alot
 9346|1|Is Reese on prozac or something ? This movie blows ! !
 9347|1|waste of money !
 9348|1|SSSSTTTUUUPPPIIIDDD ! ! !
 9356|1|I had hoped to like this movie , but if just had a boring storyline in my opinion . Reese did a good job with what she had to work with , but I'd never recommend this film .
 9391|1|Fake !
 9396|1|If you put Will Smith in a movie will someone as talented as Tommy Lee Jones , you know that you are going to have one messy movie . Men In Black is an extremly boring and unfunny comedy about a secret agent who picks up a partner off the streets and must save the universe from the planet of scum .
 9412|1|Men In Black was an awful example of a Sci-Fi movie . That movie doesn't deserve recognition
 9454|1|John Cusack was in almost every scene . Therefore , I hated it . I think he's probably a nice guy , but definitely overrated . Successful only because other stars are in his movies .
 9457|1|This movie just wasn't that good . It was a long , boring story about a guy that has trouble finding the right woman .
 9494|1|The best thing about South Park on TV is that they push the envelope and I love that . This movie is just awful it had no redeaming value what so ever . It was out to shock and disgust and it was really just sad . The guy could have come up with a much better plot . Terrenance and Phillip suck on the show they should have never been in the movie . Timmy Rules .
 9499|1|can you say 'stupidity' ? ? ? This has got to be the worst animated movie of the century .
 9504|1|Anyone that watches South Park has to be a goof . I mean , the show holds the record for most profanities . This show gets a movie , but Frasier doesn't ! Or Star Trek : Deep SPace Nine ! Or Home Improvement ! It's crazy , I tell you . Avoid this movie at all costs . It isn't rated-R for nothing you know . . .
 9509|1|It proves that cartoons are not meant for the big screen .
 9512|1|bigger , longer , uncut , brain-dead , unalterated junk . given the rating it has by today's juvenile airheads , they make a great argument for total 'dicktatorships' . this movie came to us via the south end of a jackass going north . . . .
 9527|1|I'm still waiting for the funny parts . . .
 9528|1|was not impressed with the movie at all
 9566|1|TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ! Her only good movie was Chicago , and I didnt even like that movie b / c of her !
 9572|1|renee look at her smile
 9607|1|The title describes people who paid good money to go seek this mutated turkey !
 9616|1|The title refers to the intelligence of the people who give it 5 stars .
 9633|1|. . . and dumber . . . and dumber . . . and dumber . . . and dumber . . .
 9646|1|Should have been called Dumb and if you pay to watch it , you are even Dumber ! Most comedians don't know the difference between inspired lunacy and the regular , tasteless kind and this is definitely the latter .
 9650|1|this rating is only here because the site wont let you give it a nothing thank God that i did not pay to see this moive
  966|1|This movie was fake . Jaws really looked fake . Bad acting . It was too unrealistic . There are no sharks that eat people .
 9669|1|This was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time . Word of warning : it's called Dumb and Dumber for a reason . It starts out dumb and keeps getting dumber and dumber . I was VERY disappointed in Jim Carrey .
 9670|1|The title says it all . The plot makes no sense , the jokes aren't that funny , and the jokes REALLY aren't funny . The ONLY funny moment was Both of them ? Maybe if I enjoyed that genre I would've enjoyed the movie , but I DIDN'T .
 9683|1|Eww disgusting . In my opinion , this show promotes homosexuality . I mean come on , a 30 year old man running around in tights , and his best friends an 11 year old . Gross
 9688|1|Will tries to hard he just didnt make it funny
 9706|1|You've got to be kidding . Isn't this a bit much for a marketing ploy . What wonderful reviews !
 9715|1|The movie is rather bland , with sparse moments of weak laughter to break the drawn out moments of predictable and dull events . I was all hyped up by the commercials that looked so promising , and then utterly disappointed when I left the theater ( which I shouldnt have even entered ) after 115 minutes of infantilizing ( and somewhat sleazy ) humor and awkward , repetitious dialogue ( ok , I get it 8 out of 10 women think that the first kiss is important . Let it go already ) . Youd think a movie with Will Smith and Kevin James would be hilarious , but not even the best of actors can make this clich � � laden script work on the screen . Best see another movie instead .
 9719|1|The fema nazis loved this one . Every man is a pig and deserves what he gets , because all guys cheat on their wives . Thats pretty much the message in this very unfunny movie about 3 spite filled women seeking revenge on their rotten husbands .
 9736|1|Just two words : not funny
 9758|1|Sucked . I totally didn't get what all the hype was about .
 9772|1|Excuse me , these couldn't even be court jesters ! The ORIGINAL kings of Comedy were masters like Bob Hope , Dick Van Dyke , Bill Cosby , Desi Arnaz , Danny Thomas and a few others . A stand-up routine based on dirty and profanity-filled humor that is simply atrocious . NOT Recommended !
 9773|1|awful movie . .
 9804|1|A shameless Clinton apology from the Meathead . Meathead , I thought you were ACTING when you played ultra-liberal Mike Stivic . I was wrong . Stick with compelling films like This is Spinal Tap , The Princess Bride , and even A Few Good Men ( has liberal leanings , but was told in a compelling way - not an attempt to brainwash like recent Meathead films ) . Let me tell you something buddy : You are a MEATHEAD - dead from the neck up . MEAT-HEAD .
  981|1|Most war movies are just terrible , nihilistic , and dark . This one is no exception to that unfortunate rule .
 9821|1|THIS MOVIE ISN'T FUNNY , not a bad movie for the period , NOT FUNNY THOUGH !
 9828|1|A bad movie by bad actresses .
 9838|1|Mira Sorvino wonders why her career went downhill ?
 9851|1|Looked really funny from the trailers , but ended up being just plain disgusting . How do the Wayans bros . still find work ? If you want a dirty joke movie thats really hilarious watch Baseketball .
 9854|1|I HATE this movie it's gross and digusting ! and I'm a big horror movie fan and I don't like the fact that they make fun of horror movies ! if they make fun of Halloween or Texas Chainsaw massacre or Phantasm I'm gonna rip thier TONGUE OUT ! ! biggest waste of my time my friend made my watch this with her GEEZ and the humor does not really amuse me it's just gross !
 9860|1|Possibly the lamest , most low-brow piece of crap to ever hit the silver screen . Just a bunch of crap sex jokes and stupid parodies that a monkey could have thought of . Actually , no , I take that back . That comment is insulting to monkey's . Just another typical teen-style crude-fest . Avoid if you have a brain .
 9861|1|More sickening then scarry . It just seemed like one big sex scene for about half the movie .
 9867|1|this movie sucked !
 9869|1|another one for the airheads . . . while the movie made a concerted effort at a spoof , the tasteless writing makes one want to gag ( no pun intended ) . . . constantly falls back on every lobotomized producers fail-safe fall-back for a zero : the f-word . . . not the least bit 'funny' , but obviously the age genre this movie is geared towards would not know the difference . . .
 9874|1|One of the dirtiest movies of the summer . It is a movie that one can not enjoy with a family . People think that American Pie was bad , it is nothing compared to this . I had to literally leave the movie because it was so bad .
 9892|1|Come on guys ! anyone who said this movie was even worth wasting your time is crazy ! I didn't think it would be the best movie , but it was sooooo stupid . All it was about was vulgur crap . it wasn't even stupid funny , it wasn't funny at all ! ! ! it was way to childish and corny .
 9912|1|This movie is too stupid . It goes beyond stupid funny ( like Jim Carrey ) , and stops at horribly stupid funny .
 9941|1|This movie sucked . There were a few funny parts but overall it wsa just really disgusting . Also , it had absolutely no plot .
 9943|1|What the heck was Scary Movie about ? Man , it was all about penises and boobs ! The movie had no point whatsoever . I thought it was going to be a funny , good movie when I saw the commercial for it . So , I went to go watch it on the first day the movie came out . I came out dissapointed . I really expected much more .
 9945|1|It sucked . I hated it . It wasn't funny . Some parts were too explicit , like the deaths and showing a penis . I went with my ex-girlfriend . Usually the movies she picks out are good but she couldn't cover up this terrible movie .
 9948|1|I thought this movie was dumb . I should have went high . Seriously , I laughed once .
 9952|1|If there is a zero in the rating system , I would give it to this movie . It could be that this is 'the biggest wast of time ever . . . ' . I lost 2 hours of my life watching 'Stupid Movie' .
 9958|1|There is no plot but just a montage of recent horror movies . The previews do not reflect the movie's poorly written plot . Just seems like they wanted to show as many penises as possible .
   10|5|Perhaps the perfect action thriller movie . Funny , suspenseful , dramatic , action packed . Has it all .
  100|5|A well constructed thriller .
 1000|5|My favorite action movie yet !
10001|5|I love this movie ! I bought it on DVD when it came out . It's better than the original , and Jamie Lee and Lindsey were great .
10006|5|funny funny funny
10007|5|Really funny
 1001|5|The first time I saw this was in a huge . packed cinema with surround sound etc . . I left feeling exhausted , as if I had actually been involved in the scenario . Excellent , and you can watch it over and over again .
10011|5|Funny movie all around . It's kinda weird to see Professor McGonagall from the Harry Potter flicks as a nun ! Great musical interpetation of MY GUY by the nun's choir . Rather than making fun of religion , I think it shows that religion can be a fun thing , and there is nothing wrong with that ! !
10012|5|On e of the best movies that Whoopi made !
10015|5|Hysterical . The idea of Whoopi Goldberg as a nun is funny enough . With the soundtrack and the dialogue in this movie , it's flat hysterical . Excellent movie .
10021|5|I nearly peed my pants ! It is so funny . Whoope Goldberg is a gem .
10022|5|Whoopi Goldberg can be funny at times , but she's so often in films that don't fit with her style . Sister Act was the perfect film for her , a Vegas lounge singer hiding from the mob in a convent . Predictably , she turns the lives of the nuns upside down , and they , in effect , have a big influence on her . The personalities of the show's stars--Whoopi , Harvey Keitel , Mary Wickes , Kathy Najimy , and Maggie Smith--are so winning , you overlook some of the obvious cliches .
10024|5|I loved this movie . I've watched it again and again and laugh every time . The sequel ruined the series . Goldberg plays the role of Sister Mary Clarence superbly .
 1003|5|Very well done from every angle . A tough action film to beat .
10039|5|Hilarous and funny KICK ACE MOVIE LOVE IT !
 1004|5|Great film , Alan Rickman is one of my favorite things about this film .
10042|5|One of Adam's best . Those kids playing Frankenstein were great . Do you want to put on a hooters shirt for old times sake ? Whats he talking about mommy ?
10048|5|it funny and sweet , and all round good movie
 1005|5|I loved this movie ! The action is great , and i like how Bruce Willis gets his butt kicked throughout the movie ( unlike other i-can-kick-high-so-bullets-can't-hurt-me action movies . ) Alan Rickman plays a great villain . Even though the movie is totally dated now , it's still fun brain candy !
10050|5|This movie is hallirous ! The little boy is dang cute ! It has something for everyones taste ! If you have not seen it yet i suggest that you go down to blockbuster right now and rent it , you will luv it ! !
10051|5|A good comedy should be hilarious of course , but it should also tell a story that alters the main character in some way , as well as touches and engages the viewer . Big Daddy has it all , and Adam Sandler was flawless and brilliant ! ! ! A must-see ! ! !
10054|5|This is one of my favourite movies . It's really funny and it's sweet too . Adam Sandler does a great job and the little boy in the movie is really cute . This movie is definitely worth seeing .
10058|5|amazing movie , shame it didnt have a few of the trailer clips in it , which i was suprised at . but really funny and makes you think . not too fussed on lyndsey lohan bt i liked her in this . ace ! !
 1006|5|A blast ! Bought the DVD set . Great comic book escapism . Alan Rickman was terrific .
 1007|5|Along with Lethal Weapon , Die Hard easily makes my list of the top action films of the lasy 20 years . It's your typical shoot em' up flick with Willis playing the macho cop John McClane , who must face off terrorists in an office building 3 , 000 miles out of his jurisdiction . Solid performances by Willis and Reginald Veljohnson are the film's high points , but the biggest props have to go to Alan Rickman , a relatively unknown actor who played the role of Hans Gruber very convincingly . Overall , Die Hard is the film to watch if you're looking for some good action mixed with a little bit of comedy .
10079|5|Great film and Carey proves he can act when he wants to prove it but I don't think it belongs in the comedy category .
10093|5|A fantastic movie ; side splittingly funny at times , romantic , poignant . It plays on the rabbi / priest stereotypes with humour but sensitivity . The happy ending is of course not unexpected but the film sets out to end on a happy note , friendship prevails . A strong directing debut from Edward Norton , one of the most talented actors around today , and he , Jenna Elfman and Ben Stiller are all very believable in their roles . A great movie .
10094|5|This movie was GREAT ! ! I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie . The cast was great , the acting was great . I just love Ben Stiller and Edward Norton . Jenna Elfman is just breath-taking ! ! !
10096|5|Extremely funny . Great acting , great script . I work in a video store and everyone loved it .
10098|5|Very funny , especially Norton , Wallach and Forman !
  101|5|By far the best of the Hannibal trilogy of movies . Anthony Hopkins , Jodie Foster and the entire cast work so well together . This movie did the book justice . Creepy , sadistic , thrilling . A Classic !
 1010|5|Innocent People were held hostage in a high rise building , and Bruce Willis saves the day . The storyline was easy to follow . The action was top notch even though the movie was made way back . It has lots of good gun fights similar to John Woo films , and Bruce Willis had the tough guy sort of look throughout the whole movie , he was perfect for the role . I would agree that this original one is the best of the trilogy .
10104|5|wow i would actually want to be friends with these characters , and i very seldom find that to be true with this kind of movie .
10105|5|Great movie ! Very funny and a unique topic . Not stupid funny the way a lot of movies are trying to be . Quality humor .
10106|5|This movie was hilarious . The actors worked well together and fit their parts .
10109|5|Wonderful . I loved the extension and development of the Priest / Rabbi jokes . Great acting from Edward Norton , Ben Stiller , and Jenna Elfman .
 1011|5|this movie was the best of all the die hards . . an amazin trilogy it has been . . hopefully they make the fourth one . . bruce willis is amazin . . . all the explosions in this movie were truly amazin . . the dialogue was good even tho most of it was only abuses . . this movie proves one thing . . BRUCE WILLIS IS THE GOD OF ACTION MOVIES
10111|5|Jenna Elfman , Ben Stiller , and Edward Norton do justice to one of the oldest jokes around . A priest and a rabbi walk into a . . . This is a movie that all will enjoy , and if you grew up in a Jewish or Catholic religion you'll have a better appreciation of where you come from , that , and you'll be laughing your butt off !
10112|5|This movie was great . The movie was about three people who were best friends when they were younger . One became a priest , one a rabbi , and the girl fell in love with one of them at the same time when the other guy fell in love with her . A love triangle formed between the three characters .
10131|5|Great competitive movie with a sense of humor that was also emotionally tear jerking at the end , but it ended well . I would go see it again .
10133|5|Very much a good movie . Shows they way that cheerleaders work . Lots of hotties .
10134|5|Packed full of action . Being a dancer , it was very exciting to me . I like watching cheerleading competitions .
10135|5|The movie had an interesting plot about how they were always winning and ended up losing to the rival . The movie has a good ending .
10136|5|I think this movie was great from its success in combining comedy and a real life case . It had all sorts of high school guys getting together in a challenging teamwork to make a dream come true . From one side , it had many funny situations and from the other , it made you feel what the challenge means and lets you hit with the MUZIK ! ! !
 1014|5|A genre defining film with a lead character that was tough but vulnerable . I still watch this film on a regular basis as it became the action picture by which most others are compared . Willis was perfectly cast for this role and Rickman gives a fantastic performance .
10148|5|Bring it on is a great movie , especially for young people . It's about cheerleaders , teenagers , etc . I think that it's a great movie and is worth the money spent . I'm willing to buy that movie when it comes out .
 1015|5|Exellent its one of the best action films of all time Dynomite
10152|5|Bring it On starts with no storyline but the story picks up . The dancing is awesome and I enjoyed the drama .
 1016|5|A classic shoot-em-up , kill-the-bad-guys movie that should rank up there with Dirty Harry . It ranks # 146 out of 250 films of all time on imdb . com -- The comedic one liners are skillfully written into a predominately violent movie . This was also a make-or-break movie for Bruce Willis to see if he could break out of the Moonlighting TV show mold . He did it flawlessly and became an A-list actor .
10161|5|Thosee girls where so hot . The movie was funny also .
10168|5|I think it is a totally awesome movie ! Alicia is great and I hav 2 give snaps 2 Stacy an Donald they were so funnyyo whats up u jeepin behind my back ? ha
10171|5|I have been obsessed with this movie since it came out when I was in 7th grade . It took me 20 times watching it to figure out the hip lingo and I even counted Cher's outfits : 42 !
10174|5|This is my all time favortie movie . It is hilarious and upbeat , and even though she seems ditzy , we can all relate to cher's problems .
10178|5|Good comedy for teenagers . Really cute movie about sex and teenagers .
10181|5|I don't ordinarily think of this as a great movie , but it is one that -- when you click by and see it on TV -- I always want to watch . The script is really memorable , the storyline is oddly sweet , and the characters are pulled off convincingly .
10193|5|This is great ! I was blown away the first time I saw it , it's hilarious , sad , everything . Peter Sellers is absolutely wonderful as Chance , and Being There is just a great movie . I loved the atmosphere , and I don't think I can find much wrong with it . You should see it if you're a movie fan . Being There is great . Summary : HILARIOUS , SAD , GREAT . SELLERS IS MARVELOUS .
10197|5|like I said there isnt one movie with Johnny Depp that I dont like I loved it he was a really funny guy in there and yeah it was great .
10198|5|John Waters is truly one of the best out there in the entertainment industry . This musical of a movie was so cute , I truly enjoyed it . Ricki Lake also did a great job in this movie . I highly recommend it to John Waters fans and musical fans alike .
10199|5|It's probably one of the only musicals I actually like . It stars Johnny Depp as a very angry self-confessed juvenile delinquent with his friends Milton , Wanda , and Milton's girlfriend Hatchet-Face . Then they befriend an uptight prudish girl named Allison Vernon Williams ( Amy Locane ) . Their lifestyles collide and lots of hysteria and chaos unravels .
 1020|5|It's been rather difficult of late doing without any Bruce Willis Die Hard Movies . Realizing of course how John McClain is pretty much worn out . . . ca-poots-kah . . ! But who can blame the dude , after all those disgusting messes those Grueber Dudes put him through . Ya know what I'm sayin ? Those guys had John climbin up elevator shafts and shootin at him then blowin things up all around John . . . and terrible stuff like that . Oh well , thanks for the memorys John McClain you were a shining example of courage in the NYPD . . . fer sure dude . Perhaps now that John's pretty much exhausted his role as super NY Cop . . . well , maybe John can get on as a rent a cop with some late night warehouse in the east side of NY . Best movies ever ; those Die Hard Series . Yep , no doubt about it . . . fer sure . John was the best .
10202|5|real great movie its about a girl who wants to find her true dreams well then theres some problems its not just easy squezzy she has a boy who likes her and almost get fired
10208|5|piper perabo hubba hubba
10212|5|OK folks , it's not going to win an OSCAR and it's not going to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival , but it is a great movie . Piper Perabo , who played the lead character Violet has that Aww shucks sexy girl next door look that you would either want for your daughter or girlfriend . The music was great and I personally like LeAnn Rimes who plays herself in this movie and does the actual singing . I like movies for their entertainment value . I want to sit down , relax and be entertained and this movie does that for me .
10216|5|Okay , so it's corny and cliche'd but it's also a LOT of fun . I really like it 'cause it's got that feel good factor about it . The soundtrack is good too , and it's ending is pure cheese fantastic ! ! !
10222|5|I loved this movie . I think it was great that she followed her dreams . It tells a great story . It one of the best movies ever .
10223|5|Very entertaining . The sound track carried the movie . The characters were believable and fun to watch . What everyone who has never been to New York hopes it is really like . John Goodman as the father was a great addition .
10224|5|At first , I thought it would be a retarded movie , until my friends showed it to me . I thought Coyote Ugly wold mainly be about strippers or some thing , but I was wrong . It was an excellent movie that I can even show to my mom .
10226|5|I LOVED IT ! ! ! I WANT TO BE A COYOTY UGLY FOR LIFE ! ! ! THE MUSIC WAS AWESOME AND I USED TO BE A DANCER SO I COULDN'T SIT STILL . I LOVE THE MUSIC AND I LOVE HOW IT MADE WOMEN FEEL LIKE THEY RULE ! ! !
10227|5|I didnt think coyote Ugly was going to be all that great . Boy was I wrong ! The plot was definetley more than I thought , the music was great , and I really got into the movie !
10228|5|Coyote Ugly was a wonderful movie , I think it really gives you inspiration . No matter how many times you watch it , it always bring a smile to my face .
10229|5|Coyote ugly is my favorite movie . The girls were great especially Piper Perabo . I love her so much . I would do anything to meet her . she is the most amazing , beautiful woman i have ever seen .
10230|5|Coyote Ugly was a fantastic movie ! I love the story line and the cast ! It made me want to get up and become a Coyote . Two thumbs up ! Great movie !
10231|5|I thought that Coyote Ugly was a great movie ! ! ! Makes you believe that if you put your mind to it , you can make your dreams come true . I'm in the business and would love to own a bar like that . The music also stays with you , you'll be singing it for days , until you finally buy the C . D .
10232|5|Coyote Ugly was one of the best movies ever ! Granted , speaking as a guy , I don't really have much bias given the girls , but at least it had a plot , and I'm thankful for that . My suggestion to you is if you like attractive women , and romantic comedies . . . I would definitely see this movie !
10236|5|Very predictable storyline and plot , but it was still a very good movie . Great line dancing in the movie . It had a good enough ending .
10238|5|Another great movie that I didn't mind paying eight dollars to watch . This was a total chick flick . I went to see it with my sister and I enjoyed it so much that I was talking about it for hours afterwards .
10239|5|It was a better movie than I thought it would be . It is a chick and dude movie because of the girls and the sentiment .
 1024|5|The greatest ordinary superhero of all time fights terrorists and beats them starting with one gun and no shoes .
10243|5|This was a good movie about how some women get paid for doing a job as a bartender . There is a good plot for her singing career . She never gave up .
10244|5|I liked this movie because it has hot girls dancing in it . I think it appeals to many guys . There is also a theme to the movie to follow your dreams , which is pretty cool since it will attract the girls . Something for everyone .
 1025|5|A great adrenaline rush , a real guy movie with buildings blowing up left and right . Die Hard two and three are not as good as the original . Bruce Willis was the man in the movie .
10255|5|I thought this movie was really good . It left me in a feel good mood . It was very interesting . There hasn't been any movies out lately about a singer .
 1026|5|This is a wonderful and excellent movie ! ! ! ! !
10264|5|I loved this movie because of the fun adventure that this young girl goes through . The cast is fun and I liked it because they made it so believeable . This movie made the audience want to go be a bartender ( and go buy the soundtrack ) .
10269|5|I loved this movie ! It was a good chick flick that I would go to even with guys . My boyfriend liked it because of the hot chicks dancing on the bar and drinking all that alcohol .
 1027|5|A great action movie . Lots of great one-liners , cool explosions , and a good plot . Bruce Willis is the man .
10272|5|I LOVED this movie ! It was just a really fun movie ! ( not to mention Adam Garcia ! ) The music was awesome and I found myself singing 'Can't fight the moon light' for weeks . 5 stars .
10274|5|This movie is really good . It shows that girls can have a good time while running a bar . Me and my friends related to the characters in the movie .
10288|5|black women in all-white neighborhoods are funny .
 1029|5|The fighting scenes aren't so fake like in those Steven Segal movies . The only movie that I like of his .
10299|5|Very funny ! Enjoyed every minute of it .
10300|5|Offensive , but hilariously funny comedy . Steve Martin plays a divorced lawyer who's life is pretty dull . His life revolves around his two children , and he gets little free time . That is until Charlene , played by Queen Latifah comes into his life . She wants him to help her call out her true innocence , and find the person who committed the crime for which she is charged for . And with a hilarius supporting cast of Betty White , Jean Smart , and Eugene Levy . . . you can't get any better .
10304|5|This movie established Jim Carrey as one of the most hilarious and goofy guys of all time . This movie got me hooked on Jim Carrey and I remember all the kids trying to impersonate his craziness .
10308|5|This has got to be the funniest movie out there . Jim Carrey his fabulous ! What the heck is it doing all the way down at 127 ? ? ?
10309|5|I think this is a great movie . I have seen this so many times I know it word for word through the whole movie and I can do the fast-talking sequence ( what you wouldn't read about is how ray finkle lost his mind was committed to a mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even with Dan Marino who he blamed for the entire thing ) faster than Jim Carrey in the movie and yet I still laugh at the jokes . My favourite part is when Ace turns up at Ray Finkles house and says hi , I'm looking for Ray Finkle then a shotgun is pointed to is head . He replies and a clean pair of shorts . And when asked over the phone by Courtney Cox where he is , he says I'm in Phsychoville and Finkle's the Mayor . All in all one of Carreys best performances . The sequel was crap .
 1031|5|Die Hard was a good movie . The actors were good . They storyline was great , how he had to save the building .
10313|5|Perfectly wild physical comedy from the master himself . A fun movie and a classic of it's kind .
10317|5|I love this movie even though I am not a big fan of Jim Carey . This movie is sooooo funny ! I have seen it a lot with my best friend but , we still crack up through most of the movie .
10318|5|My best friend and I love this movie ! ! ! We've seen this movie a lot and every time we laugh at it really enjoy it ! But I have to admit , I like the sequal better ( Ace Ventura When Nature Calls )
10321|5|so funny , if i would've been filming it i wouldv'e been a little iffy , but they took a chance and it worked !
10327|5|- Hilarious . Very funny , it will make you laugh on the worst day . They picked the right actor for the movie ( Jim Carrey ) .
10333|5|An excellent wild and extravagant comedy where Jim Carrey is completely insane , but yet a plot still exists .
10337|5|Released in 2002 and directed by Alexander Payne , About Schmidt is a dark comedy that has a very flat , intentionally plodding pace . The film almost exclusively centers around Warren Schmidt ( Jack Nicholson ) who is forced into retirement from his job as an insurance actuary . Schmidt quickly finds that his wife is essentially a stranger , and he turns to sponsoring an orphan boy in Africa named Ndugu . After his wife unexpectantly dies and in search of entertainment and change , Schmidt purchases an RV and begins a trip to Colorado to try to stop his daughter ( Hope Davis ) from marrying a waterbed salesman ( Dermot Mulroney ) . Arriving in Colorado , Schmidt is faced with his future in-law ( Kathy Bates ) . Viewers looking for more action miss the point of this film as the humor is intentionally dark and dialogue driven , and the pace is intentionally plodding to match the aura of Schmidt's new life . Though the in-laws are supposed to be portrayed as eccentric and over the top , Bates' persona was a bit excessive ; however , Davis as Schmidt's no frills daughter was wonderful . What makes this film work is the casting and effort of Nicholson who can portray a man boiling inside , yet never erupts save within the anonymity of his letters to Ndugu which are the highlights of the film and move the story along . The bottom line is that About Schmidt is a cerebral black comedy that is not for everyone , but a must see for those who like the genre .
 1034|5|It was great . I liked the explosions . It was tight how the dude fell at the end . It was more good stuff .
10342|5|Three words . . . Kathey Bates Naked ! ! !
10344|5|Kathy Bates stole the show . Great acting and deserves a definite 5 .
10345|5|a great movie . . . gained new respect for Nicolson . . . . it tugged at a lot of emotions . . . . dealt with issues people my age face . .
 1035|5|I gave this a 5 because this movie was ahead of its time . It was the first badass , hostage dituation where the bad guys are being chased by the good guy . All three Die Hard movies are awesome , but the original has the best storyline .
10351|5|A fantastic movie about a recent retiree ( Nicholson ) who is looking back on his life while facing his final years . Parts of the story are told through letters Nicholson writes to a child in Africa that he is sponsoring , which adds a nice touch to the movie . Kathy Bates steals every scene where she appears in her supporting role .
10352|5|Great movie , I recommend it for anyone in the mood for a good hearted film . Jack Nicholson was just great in this movie . It was much funnier than what I thought it was going to be . One of the best movies of 2002 , a must see .
10355|5|i feel pretty , o so pretty , i feel pretty , & witty , & GAY !
10358|5|they picked the perfect actor Adam Sandler to be in anger management he looks just like the type to flip out .
10362|5|Wounderful I still laugh when I think of it .
10372|5|Completely equal if not superior to the origional . Another hilarious movie with a whole lot of whacky comedy . I loved it when he tried to prove that Dr . Mainheimer was a fake by trying to scrub his birthmark off . Absolutely hilarious and IMO better than the first .
10374|5|Extremly funny sequel .
10375|5|One of the best sequels of all time . However , 33 1 / 3 really sucked .
10377|5|Gossip . . . . gossip . . . we want gossip . . . .
 1038|5|My favorite Bruce Willis movie . You gotta love the scene when he runs through the cut glass .
10387|5|This film will be studied in years to come . The subtlties pay re-watching it .
 1039|5|Every single one is great !
10392|5|This is one of my favorite comedies of all time . I love this movie . I love every Robin Hood Movie . He has been my hero since I was like 3 years old . Robin Hood is so cool .
10395|5|- I think callmetootie's lizard's looking a little limp . -
10398|5|This is one of the greatest movies of all time , next to Wayne's World , Austin Powers and A Life Less Ordinary .
  104|5|This movie was thrilling from beginning to end . Very few dull spots , and Jodie Foster is so believable in her character that it gave me goose bumps . While I normally do not care for movies that involve serial killers , this movie is a MUST-SEE for those seeking a good Jodie Foster movie . It can be kinda scary at times as well . Not a recommended movie for children however .
10404|5|MEL BROOKS IS THE MAN ! This and every other movie mel brooks has done i have loved , HILARIOUS !
10406|5|My favorite movie OF ALL TIME ! The auditioning scenes and the You're bastard people scenes are genius . All the characters are hilarious , dim and clueless , but you find yourself loving them and rooting for them anyway .
10410|5|Christopher Guest is wonderful in this movie . he was born to be in it ! nothing may ever happen on mars but something is definitely cooking in Blaine , mIssouri . A delightful play for people of all ages . If you have not seen this peice of comedic genius then you have not lived .
10414|5|Hysterical parody . This is Spinal Tap in a small town community theatre .
10423|5|i own the dvd . helen hunt is amazing
10427|5|This was a hell of a movie . Funny , clever , Mel and Helen have a fantastic chemistry , etc .
10432|5|Mel Gibson was funny ! Who knew ? Great message about what men are missing .
10433|5|Very funny
10435|5|Mel Gibson is the best
10437|5|I give this movie a 5 for origionality and charm ! Mel Gibson and Helin Hunt get two thumbs up !
10438|5|Didn't understand it but it made me laugh !
 1044|5|Frances McDormand was fabulous in this movie . " I suppose that's your partner in the wood chipper . "
10440|5|The jokes never seemed to wear out for me , even though I went to see the movie 4 times . It was a brilliant film , brings you back to see it a second time . I reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to see Mel Gibson's acting in a different kind of genre . It's a great movie . Helen Hunt and Mel definetly look cute together . Go see it !
10446|5|What Women Want . . . was absolutly hilarious ! And can Nick Marshall ever show the audiance a good time in the sack ! Its a must see ! This will be out on video May 8th , 2001 Mel-hugs Nan
 1045|5|Hilarious , nasty , and utterly brilliant . One of the best films of the decade .
10450|5|An instant classic !
10458|5|Very funny . I enjoy this movie so much that I can watch it over and over .
 1046|5|Alright , the Norwegian accents are way over the top , but this is still destined for cult status .
10464|5|It was a very funny movie every body played there part very well and picked the perfect person for it .
10469|5|one of the best road movies ever made
 1047|5|Just a good movie . really nothing of merit dramawise , nor acting that could be called great . It just somehow works . Keeps you interested from the begining untill the end . Good Movie . IJR says check it out !
10471|5|Have given this movie a five because it gives you what you want - a funny , engaging , film that leaves you satisfied that you paid your money to watch . With some movies you are waiting for the laughs to materialise but this film has a high quota , both visual and in the dialogue and some clever editing / storytelling to keep the plot moving apace . In this film you start off liking the characters and by the end you are rooting for them in all their travails in life , be it retrieving the sex video or getting laid . There are some funny subplots too such as Tom Green's attempt to feed the snake and the girl's trip to Boston instead of Austin . The writers have used the premise of If we could do anything we wanted and get away with it what would we do ? and so we see the theft of a Blind School's bus , an all-black fraternity house , masturbation , and car jumping . It's all good fun and so I would recommend to watch this film . . . . although not with your parents !
10472|5|The funniest movie i have seen in my entire life . Such in incredible comedic feat will take a huge comedy to parralell . Tom Green did a spectacular job . a must see .
10476|5|This was a really good movie . I loved it . It was original and really funny . It keeps you constantly laughing and so holds your attention right throughout the movie .
10477|5|This movie was as good as it gets ! Though its not the best , its close to it ! If ur in ur early 20's , or a teenager this will defidently make u laugh !
10478|5|Road Trip is hilarious ! With many classic lines and situations , this movie is a must see . I recommend it whole heartedly .
10485|5|So funny ! See it with college pals and laugh your butt off !
10492|5|Very funny , great movie ! Tom Green was funny . The story was good as well .
10495|5|It is a funny depiction of fictional college life . Overall , I was amused .
  105|5|Classic . Hopkins - great ! I like it when it looks like Jodie Foster is going to shoot me .
10508|5|One of Eddie Murphy's greatest films . Even Arsenio couldn't mess this film up .
10514|5|the movie was great Who cannot love Macauley ? Lets just say he's a pretty cool guy , believe me , take it from someone who knows him well .
 1052|5|Probably more of a dark comedy than an action thriller - one of my favorites . . .
10520|5|Mackauley Caulkin at his best ! A wonderful , hilarious movie for the whole family to enjoy . It is an even better movie to watch during the holidays . I absolutely loved it !
10521|5|Hilarious slapstick romp !
10525|5|Sweet , original , comical , and it has a lot of heart . I could watch it over and over again .
10528|5|CLassic . . . if Macaulay Culkin could have stayed that age forever , he would be the richest guy alive . Callmetootieblows .
10529|5|I don't think it can be noted for a great deal of cinematic brilliance , but it is nonetheless a favorite among people around my age ( 13-19 ) . I must have seen it 35 times . Kids just love seeing the idea of a 10-year-old outsmarting two criminal bandits . The physical abuse they endure at the hands of Kevin McCallister is the extremely humorous part . Also , everyone has been angry at their family and felt left out at one point or another ; but it teaches that you have to look past that and be with your family ( especially during the holiday season ) .
 1053|5|I loved it . It had some great moments . hilarious and scary as hell .
10530|5|This is one we try to catch every Christmas . Kevin gets left alone , and he winds up fending off crooks who are trying to clean the place out . Some of it is barely believable , and credibility is stretched to the limit , but put your brain on hold for an hour and a half and you'll probably enjoy this .
10533|5|Great christmas movie ! ! ! ! !
10534|5|Once in a few years , one movie comes out that is a total surprise to you , and eventully you find out everyone else thought and felt the same way . Home Alone is the best movie of 1990 , and Culkin is just such a sweetheart and a great kid .
10538|5|Good Christmas movie about having a kid at home being robbed and he gives the robbers a time of their life .
10544|5|This movie changed the world , the history the film industry ! Showed us something we hadn't seen before ! One of the few things that still give me Christmas feeling ! And it's still one of my favourite comedies as well as family films ! And yeh : Macaulay Culkin is absolutely fantastic ! : o )
10546|5|A fun fantasy
10550|5|As with most Reese Witherspoon flicks , the key word is cute . This movie was a pleasant surprise . The actors were all talented that charmed you . The typical , sweet story of country girl goes to the big city , lost love and having to choose between the two worlds . Predictable but the joy of it is that you want it to happen predictably . . . with the happy ending .
 1056|5|Released in 1996 and directed by Joel Coen , Fargo is an eccentric , black comedy detective film set primarily in Minnesota . For the uninitiated , the plot involves dishonest car salesman Jerry Lundegaard ( William H . Macy ) who must find money quick to bail him out of an insurance scam gone bad . His plan is to hire two thugs ( Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare ) to kidnap his wife so he can get the ransom from his rich father-in-law . Of course the plan goes bad resulting in several murders which brings the local ( and pregnant ) Sheriff Marge Gunderson ( Frances McDormand ) on the case . While hacking through the clues and schemes , Gunderson must deal with the weather , the odd local citizens , and food cravings . In many ways , this film is like a full-feature episode of television's Northern Exposure on steroids given the eccentric characters , climate and screenplay ; however , what makes the movie is the performances of Macy , McDormand and especially Buscemi . The latter's portrayal of swarthy kidnapper Carl Showalter is in stark contrast to the slower paced Nordic characters and scenery . In many ways , Showalter is the hare to Sheriff Gunderson's turtle which adds a feeling of tension and inevitability to the story while Macy's Lundegaard spins his wheels in proverbial quicksand only to get deeper into the quagmire he created for himself . The bottom line is that Fargo is not for everyone and is not a typical Coen brothers film ; however , for those who like cerebral black comedy , this movie is a must see .
10572|5|Funny movie ! Character development was well thought out . Storyline had good conclusion , although obvious . Kept me laughing and thrilled the whole time .
10573|5|This movie was full of comedy , action and had a little bit of romance . The football scenes were great and there were many funny parts .
10589|5|Adorable ! ! ! Funny , querky , sweet . Everything for everyone .
10590|5|I loved this movie soooooo much ! ! It proves that the snotty b @ # ch in your class and the stoner dude in your class can possibly be prom dates .
10595|5|A great movie with so many funny scenes its unbelievable , harrelson , murray and quaid were brilliant . Just like every1 else i didnt know why it wasnt a big hit-it certainly shouldve been
10597|5|murray and harrelson are unbeleivably funny
10598|5|The Farrelly Brothers' funniest movie . It should have been a hit along the lines of There's Something About Mary-- I don't know why it wasn't . This thing is hysterical , and politically incorrect . A movie Mel Brooks could have made in the '70s . Love it .
10599|5|If you like silly movies you will love this film . . . it's a keeper !
 1060|5|The characters / actors are what make this movie great . It's a bit dark and violent , so I would not recommended to everyone . Jerry Lundegaard has some financial problems so he hires some people to kidnap his wife and they would demand a ransom from her rich father . Things take a turn for the worse when they end up killing Jerry's wife and the pregnant police chief is hot on the trail . William H Macy is excellent as Lundegaard . Francis McDormand is funny and refreshing as the police chief . Steve Buscemi is superb as the violent psychopath . The movie is fresh , funny , violent , and thrilling . Quite possiblly The Coen Brothers best film .
10604|5|THIS MOVIE IS SICK BUT ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIES ESPECIALLY THE PART WITH HIS LANDLORD . COME ON , IT WASN'T THAT BAD .
10605|5|This movie kicked ass ! Funny as all hell !
 1061|5|Great movie -- I'm usually lukewarm about the Coen brothers , but this movie really touched me . My favorite part was that the cop's husband turned out to be designing stamps . Seemed at once humbe and noble .
10615|5|Wow . Hugh Grant is amazing . Jeez , I can't get enough of him . I want to see him again and again and again ! ! ! ! ! He's on my top ten list ( of male celebs ) . He's just so cool , and such a good actor , it's REALLY hard for me not to love him . This movie shows his great talent . Julia is and always will be one of the best in my book .
 1062|5|Was NOT based on a true story , contrary to what the movie claims . I don't care . I was surprised that Austin Powers was ranked higher than this one , and then more surprised that this wasn't even ranked . . . ah , they don't call this comedy ? ? I have a theory . . . if you're not from the upper midwest , you probably can't relate enough to the movie to really enjoy it . My favorite scene ? The interrogation of the driveway sweeper ! Gotta love the parkas !
 1063|5|I think Fargo is an excellent movie because it's not what you expect . I don't even know what I thought it was going to be about , but when I heard about a wood chipper , I had to see it . The performances were excellent , right down to the accents ( and yes , people do talk like that in N . D / MN , it wasn't an exaggeration , I was born in Fargo ) . I think this was William H . Macy's best performance ( portraying Jerry Lundergard ) . I love it when the finance company keeps hounding him about the VIN numbers for the vehicles , truly helarious . I questioned why the movie was called Fargo . After all , the only scene that took place in Fargo was the first five minutes of the movie , where the deal was set . The majority of the movie took place in Brainard MN . Then I finally got it . Would you rather see a movie called Fargo or Brainard ? Makes sense , huh ?
10632|5|It's hard for me to find any flaws with this movie . Gene Hackman steals the show as Royal Tenenbaum - an obnoxious patriarch who is trying to bring his hysterically disfunctional family back together again . The heavyweight cast of Hackman , Ben Stiller , Gwyneth Paltrow , Owen and Luke Wilson , Danny Glover , and Anjelica Huston turn in nearly perfect performances , and Wes Anderson adds the same quirky touches that made Rushmore such an outstanding film . This movie will make you laugh out loud , and may choke you up a little as well . To give you a sense how it was received in the theater where I saw it , most people applauded when it was over . The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the better movies I have seen in the last year or so .
10634|5|Putney Swope is an outrageously funny comedy about race relations in an imaginery Madison Avenue Ad agency in the late 1960's . Without a doubt , it is the funniest movie ever made and , because of the way it pokes fun at minorities , it will never be shown on television . You'll laugh so hard you'll wet your pants !
10639|5|Terrific movie . The best teen movie since Clueless .
 1064|5|Terrific movie and different from everything else in its genre . I loved every minute
10643|5|I totally enjoyed this film . I thought that it was in fact a really good representation of the kind of ennui that some of us felt after highschool . I think it also speaks about kids today , the post modern sense of fashion , in trying to create a look of your own and to build ideas of your own from what has gone before that is really important in looking at why society is forming the way it is . I didn't think the film came across as too biased in favor of the characters , they were often made to look rediculous . This film reminded me of the sense of confusion that we often feel as we form our identities thoughout our lives . It also mocked the collector and I think you could read social commentary in that as well . We live in such an affluent society that we can collect things , most of us don't have to worry about day to day survival , we can amass luxury items and keep them on shelves forever expanding and we can even build our identities around them as well . I read a lot into this film and I think there was a lot of meat to grab on to , lots to think about and to talk about . That to me is the mark of a really good film .
10644|5|A truly solid movie - great plot - deep , funny and well made . I like the sci-fi , thriller , drama - guy movies . However- this was such a well made movie- it goes on the top 20 list . Keeps you intereste regardless - whether you go with your friends or date - great !
10649|5|Very good film . I had been anticipating this picture heavily ever since I had fallen in love with Thora Birch in American Beauty . I was not dissapointed with this movie which is based off a sorely under appriciated graphic novel of the same title . This movie takes place following the graduation of two teenage girls who have always planned on moving in together and being forever friends . Their pleasure is scrutinizing and making fun of strangers . One day they are reading the personals and come across one that a man has placed seeking a woman he met on a plane ride . The two girls find this utterly pathetic and deside to call him , pretending to be the woman , set a date , and then go watch him as the date never shows up . Thora's character then becomes curious about the man ( Steve Buscimi ) and slowly grows attached as her best friend slowly grows away from her . Thora is in top form in this bitter comedy . She has mastered the bitter girl and I can't wait to see her in her next film . Simplistic in form and mature in subject . VERY good movie . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .
 1065|5|very funny , very smart . I love the ironic satire and unpredictable situations . steve bushemi is awsome ( one of my favorite actors ) as well as the rest of the cast . very well directed . a must see !
10650|5|a diffrent teenage movie a good story about after high school and what to do now it had the dark hair girl from american beauty and the great steve buseim .
10652|5|excellent . also preety origional . not many movies are about people who hang out at a mall . it was funny watching silent bob try to use jedi powers . also the stink pawm . i should gag someone with that someday . well here and there this movie has its legendary moments .
10653|5|Can you say EXCELLENT ? This movie was so hilarious . A definate classic in the arena of comedy movies . Jason Lee and Shannen Doughtery were wonderful in this movie . Kevin Smith is just totally awesome .
10656|5|Kevin Smith does it again with Mallrats . This movie is insanely hilarious . Jason Lee and Jeremy London both play incredibly funny characters , and the dialogue between the two , although lacking any amount of intelligence , is comic genius .
10657|5|WICKED
10658|5|Wow what can I say ? What does one base this answer on ? Directing Skills , skills of the actors , special effects ? Well what I can definately say is that Kevin Smith is pure genius . His characters are well , different . Each character's personality is specially suited for the person playing the roll . Pure genius I tell u . This is definately my favorite movie of all time . Noochie noochies everyone'
10659|5|This is the best movie in the world . Why is it ranked with She's all that and Notting Hill Not only are the characters down to realistic , but they're hilarious ! Brodie Bruce is my hero . His sarcastic wit is so perfect . I laugh harder everytime I see it . Jay and Silent Bob are the REAL American Badasses ! Their scemes are just so well worked out . The girls did well , and not's forget T . S . . I recommend this movie and a Big donut . Kudos to the cast . Mr . Jason Lee , you rock ! Words cannot express the love I have of this movie . I watch it every day !
10660|5|Kevin Smith is just wonderful . The Jersey Triology is awesome . Excitement , Adventure . Jedi craves not these things . ! ! !
10666|5|This is a fantastic movie but to me it is more of a drama with some comedy than a true sidesplitting comedy . This features a great cast of relative unknowns at the time who all went on to better things . This is something of a cult movie unknown by the masses . Check this out for a great evening of entertainment .
10667|5|How could anyone not like this movie ? It's a buddy flick with an intelligent plot and a cast of the finest up-and-coming actors of that time . Funny , touching and well worth seeing .
10668|5|Great ensemble cast and a bevy of rememberable lines . Could you have named the Colts unform's original colors .
10674|5|ADAM SANDLER ROX
10676|5|The first time I saw this movie , I thought it sucked . But , Like a fungus , it sorta grows on you . Adam Sandler is not my favorite actor , but in this film , he is just terrific . Kathy Bates , playing MAMA , gives her usual great performance , and is the highlight of the movie . Henry Winkler , fondly remembered as the Fonz , plays a losing football coach whose luck is turned around by Sandlers WATERBOY . The plot is basically predictable , but that is okay with this movie . There should be a sequell .
10679|5|I thought this movie was hilarious . I read a lot of bad reviews and wasn't expecting much . I was rolling on the floor . I'm a sports movie freak , so that probably is why I liked it better than his other movies . It's right up there with Happy Gilmore in my opinion .
10683|5|fairuza balk and adam sandler rule
10689|5|As always with Adam Sandler's movies , this is a very funny movie . It's original and a really enjoyable movie .
10690|5|Hmm . . What can I say . . . Adam Sandler . . . comedy movie with a great story . . . AMAZING ! ! ! ! ! This movie is a VERY good comedy for the whole family and Adam Sandler makes even better .
10695|5|Very funny movie about a man who takes his job very serious in being a waterboy .
10696|5|Adam Sandler is soooooo funny . One of Adam Sandler's best movies . This movie kept me laughing the whole time and I NEVER laugh during any other comedy movies .
 1070|5|This movie is terrific ! I love the dark humor and nuances . The characters are unique , quirky and so memorable . Frances McDormand is fantastic as the pregant sheriff , one of the most unique film characterizations in recent years . This movie turned me on to the Coen brothers , and while I've enjoyed most of their other films , this is their supreme achievement .
10702|5|He's the Devil !
10704|5|You can never go wrong with an Adam Sandler movie . Guaranteed laughs .
10705|5|C'mon , it's Adam Sandler combined with football . . . what's not to like ?
10707|5|Water Boy was hilarious - Adam Sandler's Best
10727|5|Pure fun ! Specially the DVD where we can watch the favorite betty's soap opera .
 1073|5|The Coen brothers did it again . Another great movie . The same sort of twisted humor is involved in this as in previous movies , yet it is much different . This movie will keep you locked in the whole time .
10735|5|This is a funny movie . The Nick Dundee is funny yet fits the real typical stereotype of an Australian . It was funny how Nick was just as skillful in the city in his own way as he was in the bush . The only problem is that if you think Australians are all like Nick Dundee and all yobos , you have another thing coming .
 1074|5|Fargo was a very original movie . I liked it so much because of its charismatic character ( especially the lady Sheriff ) and the weird turn of events .
10740|5|i STILL laugh wen i think about that girl crapping herself out the window on the police car .
10742|5|it was hilarious there was to many funny parts to think of but yeah it was very funny and very good .
10743|5|i like how varied the cast is in this film . Rowan atkinson is hilarious as a narcaleptic , Cuba Gooding Jr . is funny with his 'Lucy' counterparts , and of course , who can forget the John Lovitz hitler scene that made me laugh for twenty minutes . The entire cast works great together ! A great movie from beginning to end !
10744|5|I LOVE THIS MOVIE , IT WAS SO FUNNY . IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHO WOULD WIN THE MONEY , BUT NO ONE DID .
10746|5|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen . I didn't expect anything when I first took my kids to see it and laughed so hard I was crying ( especially during the Hitler scene ) . It is not an Oscar winner by any means , but great for mindless and relaxing comedy .
 1075|5|This movie is a black comedy that even though it was disturbing at some points , Steve Buscemi does and outstanding job . The accents in the movie was hilarious and the dialogue was subtle , yet comedic at the same time . The plot was brilliant and definitely amusing .
10752|5|MAD FUNNY ! ! SETH GREEN AND CUBA GOODING JR WAS PRICELESS IN THIS MOVIE ! ! TOO GR8
10757|5|It's definitely not the funniest movie I've ever seen , but boy , there are some scenes that are just hilarious to unearthly levels . I think what makes this comedy a good one , is its excellent cast from young to experienced . I'd probably have to point out Jon Lovits and remarkable Rowan Atkinson as the highlights in this movie . Whoopi Goldberg was ok , but her role didn't have really funny parts . It seems like the producers of this movie cast Rowan Atkinson in the condition that he would play Mr . Bean in it , and it's obviously typical Mr . Bean material you're laughing at on this movie . Wayne Knight also did a great job , and his character's personality , was also very close to the character of Newman in Seinfeld , which is what he does best . Overall , this movie is an entertaining family comedy , with some really good parts .
10761|5|It was a very funny movie I thought It didnt look very good when I seen the previews but when I seen it I was cracking up .
10771|5|Sexy , Smashing , Ausome !
10784|5|Funny .
10788|5|will ferrell was very funny I liked it alot it was a very funny movie .
 1079|5|Fun to watch . Black comedy with great acting . It was kind of weird the way they talked . The movie was based on a true story .
10790|5|An instant classic . I was in a fraternity in college so I can relate to the drinking , partying , and taking advantage of girls . In this movie , guys in their early 30's are having sort of a mid-life crisis and starting a fraternity is an escape from reality for them . Old School takes you throw some aspects of starting a fraternity and pledging , and it is hysterical .
10794|5|Will Ferrell was awesome in this film along with Vince Vaughn . . . it was hilarious all the way through !
  108|5|Breathtaking and unrivaled till date . Dark , creepy , unmoving and lifetaking . Well hello Clarice ! Hideous , murderous , cannibalistic and hungry . Do you think I am evil ?
 1080|5|Fargo is the funniest murder movie ever . I saw it in the theaters three times and then bought it right when it came out . Is that your partner in the woodchipper there ? Frances McDormand was hilarious .
10800|5|Jimmy Fallon + Queen Latifah = 1 FUNNY MOVIE
10804|5|MOVIE GOLD
10805|5|i loved this movie . all the references to past movies and cameos made it really funny and interesting for me .
10807|5|The final movie from Jay and Bob is an appropriate ending to their chuckleheaded adventures .
 1081|5|The Coen brothers produced and directed this black comedy . Twists in the movie keep you on your toes . The odd story of a kidnapping in North Dakota is shocking at times , but is always humorous and entertaining .
10811|5|really only supremely funny for those people who have seen all of Smith's movies . The funny asides and cameos make more sense . However , this movie is still full of funny moments , even if the plot is so-so . This is the type of movie where you see something new every time you see it . Plus , Ben Affleck is in this movie , and he was the * BOMB * in phantoms , yo ! ; )
10815|5|If you thought this movie was pointless and crude , then you should withhold judging it untill you see the other 4 movies in the View Askew universe . CLERKS was the first , and introduced us to Jay and Silent Bob . There was also Chasing Amy and Mallrats . The fourthfilm , perhaps the crudest and rudest of all , DOGMA . And bringing the series to its conclusion , Jay and Silent Bob . ALl five are great , and as the series goes on , the courser and funnier the movies get . If you watch it expecting to see a great film , then you will be dissappointed . You go into a movie like this expecting crude humor , and silly stuff , then you've hit the motherload with this one . I really enjoyed it .
10816|5|This movie is f * * king hilarious . I am the clit commander ! ! !
10817|5|This movie was hilarious ! I love Jay and Silent Bob ! There was a great cast of characters and cameos and Will Ferrell was great in it . One of my favourite movies .
10820|5|KICK ASS MOVIE KICK ASS
10822|5|This movie is just so funny . Kevin Smith is a good director . The only bad part is Chris Rock .
10823|5|One of the funniest movies I've ever seen . Period .
10828|5|How can you not like Jay and Silent Bob . The best comedy duo since Cheech and Chong . RECONIZE
 1083|5|The Cohen brothers have triumphed again ! McDermand and Buscemi are wonderful . I probably would have catagorized this with the comedies .
10831|5|Kevin Smith is of course my favorite writer director . This was a great was of saying goodbye to the askewniverse . It will be greatly missed . Society need someone who is not afraid to make fun of both it and himself . Only downside to this film is for those who haven't seen all of the others and won't understand all the inside jokes .
10836|5|Understated , clever and well-scripted . Not what you'd call hilarious , but very funny none the less .
10838|5|A great movie but not a comedy .
10844|5|ive seen all the scary movies and i thought the 3rd one was the best this one was funny as hell but i have to admit that scary movie went downhill because they werent being completely serious with this one . and even though a lot of people thought this one was dumb those same people still might go see the 4th one cause u never no what there gonna do in the next one i cant wait until they come out with the 4th one .
10845|5|OOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGG
10851|5|Yeah , I have this movie , it's a little scary and very funny the best funny type of scary movies ever made ! ^ ^ .
10852|5|This movie was the best . Extreamly funny ! !
10854|5|can you say funny ?
10864|5|One of the funniest yet heartfelt films i've seen in a long time . Keaton and Nicholson are terrific !
10865|5|this movie is F * * * in hilarious at first i thought i wouldnt like it but bought it and loved it ill admit that this movie has stupid humor but i like stupid humor its hard for most people to comrehend stupid humor and why its funny i love the part where well ferrel gets on stage and starts playing that one instrument and gets carried away with it and even goes into the ladies room and continues to play it . If u like weird and strange humor i suggest u go see this this is a must see movie .
10872|5|I thought this movie was HILARIOUS . Anybody who is a fan of Will Ferrell's SNL days will really enjoy this film .
10874|5|One of the best movies I ever saw . I think it's so much as the atmosphere that I liked . Very funny , a lot of memorable quotes like every movie should have , and lovable characters , ( Brick : I would like to extend to you , an invitation to . . . to the pants party . . ) Will Ferrell fits Ron Burgundy PERFECTLY and it gave a warm delight when surprise guests appeared ( Owen Wilson , Vince Vaughn , Ben Stiller [ Como estan bietches ? ! ] ) 5 STARS !
10877|5|Thoroughly enjoyed Anchorman . Will Ferrell is on a hot streak . Old School and Elf were good movies , but Ferrell's portrayal of Ron Burgundy kept me in stitches throughout the flick . The movie did a great job in placing you in the 1970s ( unlike the awful That '70s Show , which has no clue on what the '70s or humor is ) . It also captures the soul of San Diego , though some of the backdrops of the city were of recent vintage and were kind of an anachronism . The love / hate / love relationship of Burgundy and co / rival anchorwoman Veronica Corningstone ( Christina Applegate looks great ) is a riot . But the real hilarious stuff occurs with Burgundy's downright insane on-scene reporter , sports guy , and weatherman . The fight scene between Burgundy's crew and the rival station news teams ( watch for A-List cameos ) was one of the funniest fight scenes ever staged . The DVD has a ton of special features . Ferrell's music video of Afternoon Delight is spit your food out funny .
10878|5|The Best Movie I ever saw , You Stay Classy San Diego ! ! ! ! !
 1088|5|Great movie -- I'm usually lukewarm about the Coen brothers , but this movie really touched me . My favorite part was that the cop's husband turned out to be designing stamps . Seemed at once humbe and noble .
10882|5|* * Update 8 / 10 / 04 : I just saw this movie again 2 nights ago . By the beard of Zeus , it changed my life . Again . * OC : If there was a vendor selling Anchorman the dvd for $ 75 a pop in the theater lobby I would have picked up two on my way out . In case I lost one . This is top-five comedy quality on an all-time list . I'm not kidding , it's right up there with the likes of Naked Gun , Airplane , and Caddyshack . Ron Bergundy - jazz flutist , great hair , scotch-lover . A force to be reckoned with .
10884|5|I love this movie almost as much as Ron Burgandy loves scotch ! If you are into the 'Zoolander' and 'Old School' type of comedy , this one is a must see ! My friends and I have already began to quote our favorite lines . Although Ferrell hit home with this movie , it was Steve Carrell who kept me laughing . Go get your tickets NOW ! !
10889|5|Best ever but the commercial showed the least funny parts so its great
 1089|5|Artistic , stylish , sexy - captivating view of the human race - the Cohens did again ! ! !
10892|5|This is my favorite Romantic Comedy of all time-no one of my favorite movies of all time . It's defiently Cameron Crowe's best . It's about a guy named Lloyd ( John Cusack , who is absolutely wonderful in everyway . ) who falls for rich daddy's girl Ione Skye ( who's name in the movie seems to escape me at the moment , which is rather embarrasing considering I was just sprouting it's praises . Oh well . . Diane ? Is that it ? Dammit ! ) Anyway , It's a beautiful story about first love , heartbreak , loss of innocense , trust , -so many different elements . And it has one of the most romantic scenes ever to be put in a movie ever . If you've seen the movie , you know what I'm talking about-when Lloyd holds up the radio playing 'In Your Eyes' ( My favorite song . ) to girl--who's-name-I-can't-remember-dammit ! - . I have this big poster on my ceiling of that scene , with the lyrics of that song . . I like to look up at it before I go to sleep ( corny , i know . shut up . ) It gives me hope that my john cusack is out there somewhere , boom box in hand , ready to sweep me away . Too , the emotion shown when they broke up was , well , empathistic ( which isn't a word , I know . ) and heartbreaking at the same time . I very highly recommend this movie . See it with someone you care about . And because Rateitall refuses to put up it's soundrack , I will say that it too is very good , and , again , highly recommended ( look for a live version of Depeche Mode's 'Stripped' . )
10898|5|Dreyfus at his best
10899|5|One of my favorite Bill Murray movies , it's very funny and should be higher on the list .
10906|5|Another cute movie . . . . . that I absolutely love . . . . . . need I say more ?
10907|5|Another movie with a very weak script . Thank God they cast Drew Barrymore as the leading lady to save the day . . . . . she made this movie into a classic already . . . . a great comedy-romance that I enjoy watching on rainy afternoons . . . .
 1091|5|This is my all-time favorite movie .
10911|5|Ok this was one of the best movies i have ever seen ! The actors and actresses were great ! The story was romantic and funny !
10916|5|I liked this movie ! I thought it was really funny ! I guess it depends on your type . And your age . This is for the younger ones ! Hehe !
10918|5|I thought this movie was sweet , funny and romantic ! I just can't see why anyone wouldn't like it ! Drew is hysterical as a nerd , and cool as can be when she finally gets kissed !
10922|5|This was better then Home Alone 1 . Kevin's pranks against the bad guys are more inventive , plus Kevin is a bit older in this movie which makes it a bit better .
10925|5|I LOVE these films . . . . and Culkin is so cool and sweet . . . . a good young actor . . I LOVE HOME ALONE
 1093|5|an excellent story about a pathetic individual . al pacino plays a cuban better than any cuban could have . one of the best films of the 80's .
10930|5|I now realize it is a bit juvnenile , but it is the movie I have probably seen the most times in my life . I can never watch it through without cracking up at least 5 times . The idea of the 10-year-old Kevin McCallister outsmarting everyone he encounters is hilarious . One of my favorite moments is when he manipulates the movie in his hotel room to sound like it's talking to the workers at the Plaza Hotel . The schemes he devises to trick Harry and Marv are also extremely amusing . Overall , an indescribably comical movie .
10935|5|One of the rare sequels that is better than the original . A must see movie for any fan of Christmas or New York .
10937|5|Forgive me , but I adore this movie . I rented it really for lack of anything else that I really wanted to see , plus I thought it looked kinda funny . It turned out to be surprisingly adorable . Alright , fine , very unbelievable , but so what ? It's a movie , not a documentary . And I thought it did a fantastic job of portraying high school life as it really is , which many movies miss the mark on . I would consider this a chick flick , with porn stars . It really is a teenage love story , and yeah , pretty much a carbon copy of Risky Business , but in a heavy time of remakes , if there is going to be one , it might as well be a good one , and this is .
 1094|5|If one film could incapsulate the self-indulgence of the eighties onto a single piece of celluloid , it would be this one . Al Pacino plays arguably the greatest role of his prestigious career in his performance of Tony Montana , an ironic personification of the American dream . Tony is a lowly career criminal who comes to America from Communist Cuba with little more than the shirt on his back and a gleam in his eye . Fueled by his newly liberated sense of desire , he goes from rags to riches ( dealing in yayo , naturally ) . In doing so though , he becomes lax , decadent and obsessed with money . This action packed tale is a vividly painted portrait of the double-edged sword that is desire . The plentiful action scenes are inventive and Pacino lends a infectious intensity to them . Oh yes , it's funny too . Pacino's portrayal of the exaggeratedly crude Montana is side-splitting as he spouts language that would make Howard Stern wince . Scarface is the complete package , a true epic and every minute is infused with vibrant creativity .
10941|5|You'd think that this movie was all sex if you saw the trailer for it , which is why I went to see it , but it suprised me on a few levels . 1 . The movie has a decent plot . It's a typical boy-likes-girl-then-girl-hates-boy-then-they-like-each-other-and-have-sex film , but it had a plot too . 2 . The acting was o . k . You'd think it'd be bad , but it wasn't . Other than that , this movie is worth renting .
10945|5|Ok I am weird , I accept that . This show got my sides aching , it was so hysterical . I still married my husband , inspite of his opinion that this movie was not funny , but stupid . My favorite funny movie .
10946|5|the mouse in the bottle , iguess there will be no charge for this one
10947|5|One of my favorite films , Bob and Doug McKenzie rule !
 1095|5|this was a highly intense but violent movie . but it shouldnt have been a surprise because it was rated x in the beginning cuz of the violence . its a guy movie for sure but ive watched it a few times .
10950|5|A terrifically cute throwback to the 60's sex comedies . Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger are utterly charming , both pulling in their usual great performances . This film recreates the era with such fun and such joy . Also worth noting is David Hyde Pierce's wildly funny supporting performance . Great sets and costumes , hilarious jokes , and terrific actors make this a genuinely lighthearted flick worth watching .
10956|5|Hilarious romp that is part homage / part parody of the amusing sex comedies of the early 1960s . Great comedic peformances from all involved , a stylized appearance , and great jokes highlight this comedy .
10957|5|If only a girl could get by with out sex and only cholcate . . .
 1096|5|I loved this movie , I found out that me and al have so much in common , not only cocaine but i rented a tux for prom that looked just like that beach outfit he was wearing in the first scene of the movie .
10961|5|Hysterical ! I've watched it over and over .
10964|5|What an enchanting movie ! Just rented it last nite and am still humming I Can't Smile without You as well as Getting to Know You . If you are a fan of Kathy Bates , you will want to hear her singing throughout this movie . The end was especially poignant and great . Julie Andrews was a scream as she constantly tried to calm people down by singing one of her big tunes . The whole cast , including Rupert Everett and Meredith Easton were fantastic . This is a must-see in my book .
10965|5|This movie is one of the best I've ever seen and I could watch it many times . Kathy Bates stars at an ordinary housewife , whose life centers on her family and a fantasy . She wants to be a singer . Did you know Kathy Bates has a beautiful voice ? I was shocked ! She adores a British singer played by Jonathan Pryce . Just as she is about to get tickets to see her idol in person , her husband ( Dan Aykroyd ) gives her the news that he wants a divorce . This film is part musical , mostly comedy , part mystery and drama . It takes Fox's death to teach Grace ( Kathy ) how to to live : A life lived in fear isn't much fun . Grace's love is unusual because she gives it without demands . She accepted her daughter-in-law , who is a dwarf and named Grace's only grandchild Pokey . Grace never condemns and still loves everyone . This is a quirky , bizarre , very funny comedy . Grace eventually learns that there is more to life than being safe . We are prompted at the end to love unconditionally our family and friends , plus ourselves . That takes courage , but this film makes it work . The songs are fabulous and you can't help but keep singing them after the movie is over . Special guest cameo by Julie Andrews is another treat ; she plays herself and sings too . There are many other cameos , like Barry Manilow and Lynn Redgrave . Highly recommend you go rent this movie today ! !
10966|5|Utterly hilarious romp starring Eddie Murphy . Lots of great gags from slapstick to Star Trek references ! No objectionable content whatsoever ( its rated G in Canada , PG by the US MPAA ) , and an upbeat , optimistic tone is present . Highly recommended !
10970|5|Great movie . Eddie Murphy and other daddy's were hilarious !
10972|5|Best anf funniest motha lovin' movie of the year 2000
10976|5|owen luvs his mama
10988|5|LOL ! i thought this movie was soo funny ! it was much more realistic then the nutty professor . i just thought it was really good .
10989|5|I laughed mu @ $ $ off ! ! ! It was hilarious ! ! !
 1099|5|One of my favorite movies made by man . Al Pacino was as convincing in this movie as The Godfather . I always tell the truth even when I lie , -Al Pacino ( Tony Monatana )
   11|5|no one does it better than speilberg ( plus i just felt like raising the rating . )
 1100|5|Say hello to my little friend ! A little coke goes a long way , Tony . TO HATTER : okay , so it was alot of coke !
11009|5|I chose this item because it was a fun movie that all family members should enjoy . Comedy like this is what the new age culture is all about .
 1101|5|A classic . The last stand was great . They couldn't drop him . TO NUMBAH : Uhmm , a little coke ?
11013|5|It is a very funny movie and keeps you on the edge at all times . The characters played by the cast are very outstanding .
11016|5|Big Momma's house was the perfect movie to keep you laughing throughout the whole film . Martin Lawerence is an excellent actor .
11019|5|I was surprised by how funny this movie was . It fits in with the whole American Pie style comedies , with plenty of jokes about sex and drug use . The two minority characters give it a different twist though , and there is a lot of good racial humor going on .
11020|5|this is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever . . . . . . . . . everything from doogie houser to white castle ( obviously ) . . . . . . . extremely crude so not for the faint of heart
11025|5|This 1980s movie spoofs a whole lot of stuff . Weird Al was great back then . The story revolves around him buying out a crummy little television station and trying to hit it big on the air . Things get off to a very slow start but his creative ideas boost the station's success and make the you laugh . It's a great movie .
11028|5|I think it was a great love story and i loved the storyline .
11032|5|If you go in viewing this movie as what it is , a harmless , happy cinderella story , then you will find that you enjoy it a great deal . I fell in love with Anne Hathaway after seeing this movie . Anyone who doesn't see a more than a few smiles in this movie has forgotten the joys that accompany innocence .
 1104|5|A lot of profanity and violence but it's a classic . Pacino is brillant and comes across a realistic drug-dealing gangster . I want to add the extra's set to my collection .
11042|5|Loved it , Julie Andrews still as wonderful an actress / Actor as she ever was . Hope they utilize this talented actress more .
11048|5|Me scoozie , me scoozie .
11049|5|Scotty doesn't know .
 1105|5|One of Al Pachino's best roles . Absolutely wonderful ! !
11050|5|They dont make thes kind of movies fo fa @ s like ctvf47 .
11058|5|Even if you don't smoke pot this movie is hysterical . Yeah man . . Funions . . hee hee
 1106|5|A great classic about an immigrant drug dealer who works his way up to the top by being aggressive and not letting anyone get in his way . But it is this attitude which leads to his downfall - he will not listen to even his closest friends . He becomes extremely self-consumed and careless , and his high coke intake doesn't help . In the end the invincible Tony Mantana falls as quickly as he had risen .
11062|5|I love this movie . Its funny , helps me cheer up on bad days . David Chapelle rocks . It didnt take itself too seriously and is easy to enjoy .
11065|5|This is the # 4 best movie ever on my list . Mandy Moore is classic as Hilary Faye ! She understands the character and is very funny ( satirically ) . I can't stand people like those in the movie , and this satires it perfectly .
11067|5|Not too great of a comedy IMO , but it has some great messages about religion , homosexuality , and fitting in . I give it 5 stars because I am Christian but was not offended . It got me thinking , which is more than I can say about any other movie I've seen in my life .
11071|5|Ok I really loved this movie saw it twice in the movie theatre . . . I really recommend this to EVERYONE ! You know I really dont like the people that really take the jokes personally . . . hello their called jokes for a reason . And I really loved that they embraced everything with the gay community because I have a gay relative and I really thought that was so beautiful . . . go see this movie it has a wonderful message to send . . .
11072|5|Warning : Not for young audiences ; may be offensive to some due to content . Anyway : This movie is about a young girl named Mary and her senior year in her Christian high school . She loves her life , has the perfect Christian friends , and a perfect Christian boyfriend . . . at least she thinks so , until he tells her : I think I'm gay . Ouch . She goes through drastic measures to try to save him , and suddenly she realizes how imperfect her perfect Christian life really is . This movie does go into a lot of issues which may be considered offensive , but it passes very strong messages about tolerance , understanding and true friendship . Extremely funny .
11081|5|I know , I know many Jim Carrey fans out there are angry about this film because of the dirty stuff , but after watching stuff like South Park and especially The Man Show I'm used to stuff like this by now , and I welcome this side-splitter with open arms . Just brilliant comedy . Besides the REALLY gross parts .
11082|5|I don't know why , but I loved this movie . I don't think I have ever laughed so hard . I loved the part when he is running after the train and his nose is wheezing . Most people didn't like it , but I think it was good .
11087|5|Jim Carry and Renee Zellweger are such a power team ! They are great together !
11089|5|Funniest Jim Carrey movie yet ! He plays the Jekyll / Hyde role perfectly ! The scene when he first morphs from Charlie to Hank is one of the most hilarious acts of physical comedy ever !
 1109|5|Raw , brutal , real . If you think that the chainsaw scene is Hollywood , think again . One of my all time favorite flicks .
11093|5|this is one of the most funniest movies i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! I dont think that it would be as funny if someone else other than Jim Carey was playing the part of Charlie / Hank . He adds the Vibe to the movie . This is a great hilarious movie that i would recomend anyone who wants a good laugh or has a sense of humor
  111|5|One of the best of the 90s . It definitely deserved all of the Oscars it got . Great film .
11107|5|This movie was very funny and Jim Carrey was a funny character . Jim Carrey had a funny life because he had to take care of his stepkids that did not even belong to him . He even had a split personality .
11109|5|Funny movie . It was hilarious . Jim Carrey's humor and goofiness make the movie great .
 1111|5|Here's your chance to see Pacino with his face in a pile of coke . This movie is great .
11116|5|Although I hate Jim Carrey , I found myself doubled over with laughter throughout the whole movie .
11117|5|I thought that this was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while . Most of my friends didn't like it . But , I guess it was because I like Jim Carrey . It kept me laughing the whole time I was watching .
11118|5|I thought this movie was very funny . Parts I liked : white guy with black sons who were ghetto geniuses , the name of his condition , the invincible cow , Jim Carrey's physical comedy .
 1112|5|My faverout movie of all time , I'll say that first . Released to a hail of critisism . In fact they gave it an X rating , virtualy unheard of outside the world of hardcore pornography , lol . Scarface in its time boasted an all time record amount of swears , making use of the F word almost 200 times . But this film is worth more than its dated shock value . Operatic and overblown , this film apeals to anyone looking for a film with a minamum amount of arsing around - the is no love sceans no attempt to bring shade or depth to Montana's character , he is defined by his actions as a pure bad guy - the ultimate anti-hero icon . Endlessly watchable and quotable , you'll either love it for its in you r face vilolence and agression or hate it for its bloatedness and linear simplicity . Its all about one scumbags rise and fall , and alot of Coke and carnage !
11120|5|Always loved Jim Carrey movies . This movie was hilarious . When the cop had the chicken stuck in his ass , I was rolling on the floor . Great movie .
11121|5|Funniest movie I've seen this year . Jim Carey was hilarious . I would see this movie a hundred times .
11126|5|Great movie . Jim Carrey's funniest movie . He deserves an Oscar nomination .
11128|5|Really funny the whole way through . Jim Carrey puts on a great performance . Your stomach will hurt from laughing . Have a good time .
11129|5|For what it was it was great . It was a raw , raunchy comedy for hardcore comedy fans and also teenage boys . Carrey turns in another great performance and Rene Zelweger was gorgeous . Funny movie with your friends .
 1113|5|Best movie EVA ! ! ! Aint it just like that game Grand Theft Auto Vice City ? ? ?
11134|5|This is so funny . For a big laugh I would go to see this . Great for a first date !
11135|5|Hilarious ! This movie continued solid with comedy throughout , and never had a bland spot . It was laugh out loud funny . The plot was non-existent , but still great .
11136|5|Excellent movie . Jim Carey returns to his old self . This movie is comparable to Dumb and Dumber . Instead of over relying on Jim's physical comedy aspect , ( Ace Ventura 2 , Cable Guy ) an interesting plot was incorporated as well .
11157|5|The best I was literly laughing through the whole movie . Some of you people gotta lighten up
11159|5|I loved this movie , it was the best of the 3 , i though . It was so funny , I watched it with my whole family , and we all laughed , but my 9 year old brother didn't get some of it .
11161|5|grat move to just have a laugh
11163|5|I really enjoyed this film - I even saw it twice at the cinema . Yes , you could regard it as lame and just the same as the other two - but I found it hilarious . Michael Caine was fantastic and I liked the scenes where Austin Powers and Doctor Evil were at school with Basil . People relax ! Its just a silly movie for people to have a giggle .
11168|5|This movie was really funny it was better then the first and the second .
11170|5|Even thinking about this movie makes me chuckle . I just spontaneously start giggling when I think about those characters . Yes , the movie is way too crude and raunchy , even for my tastes , but the creativity of Eddie Murphy's characters makes up for that . This is not Shakespeare , so it's not the subtlety of the script I'm interested in . Okay , the truth is . . . I fast forward through the dumb parts , but the good parts are really , really good .
11172|5|When I say this movie in theatres I was crying because of Eddie Murphy's hilarious characters and phrases . I loved this movie , a 10 is what this movie deserves .
11176|5|It was good , but not as good as the 1st Nutty Professer . Go see it if you want a good laugh , though !
11182|5|Eddie Murphy is hilarious , the movie was all in all very funny , and took comedy to the next level .
11188|5|I found the Nutty Professor II to be very funny . I think it was better than the first one . Eddie Murphy is hilarious and Janet Jackson is gorgeous .
 1119|5|The movie Scarface with Al Pacino is an American movie classic filled with action and suspense . This is definitely my favorite movie of all time . From Cuban refugee to multi-millionaire , this is the best tale of the rise from the gutter to the hi-rise .
11193|5|I lauged all the way through this movie . The characters , story and Eddie made this a must see for me . Because of the Klumps I have watched my first Nutty Professor movie over and over and can't wait for the next one .
11197|5|Eddie Murphy is still great . Great impersonator . Great makeup . Makes me laugh just with ad lib . All about the dialogue .
  112|5|Truly one of the best horror movies of all time .
 1120|5|Great movie for its time . Great quotes thrown out . Al is the best . I watched it everyday one Summer . A good gangster movie , especially after the Godfathers .
11202|5|Great movie ! It kept you laughing throughout the whole movie .
11210|5|This movie is one of the best comedies out today . Jack Black is one of the funniest actors out there .
11211|5|Funniest new movie i've seen , really nothing funnier out right now . I specifically love the scene where Jack Black grabs the nacho , just like me and my bros .
11214|5|That was really funny ! i LoVe RiChArD 4 lYf ! ! ! ! !
11217|5|Kate Hudson is VERY FUNNY i LIKED IT i REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY .
 1122|5|This movie is an all time classic . Pacino ! The movie was full of action , a great story and characters . I have seen this movie a good nine times and not once has it been boring . Thumbs up !
11224|5|I'm so excited because I am the one giving the first opinion for this movie ! . . . Well you can tell I liked the movie . . in fact I loved it . . it was very funny and more of a chick flick so most guys wouldn't understand ! But i advise you to go see it !
11232|5|Great ! Jennefer Garner shines
11234|5|This movie was VERY cute and I loved it . I love the 80s music they put in like Jesse's Girl and Love is a Battlefeild .
11239|5|This was such a great movie ! I loved it . It was sweet and it kind of relates to how girls act when they are young and will do anything to be popular . But in this movie , it proves that bening popular isn't the best thing you can have and that you should stick with your true friends . This movie showed a message and it was great ! If you haven't seen this movie , It is a definite movie that you should go see
 1124|5|The best gangster movie ever . Every movie since has paled in comparison . Al Pacino was excellent . He played his part as if he was a real life mobster . I really like the realism and drama .
 1125|5|My favorite gangsta' movie of all time is Scarface . It's a timeless scrutiny of the Mafia life . If you like the Mob this is the movie for you .
11253|5|SOOOO funny . . . i still cant get over that they had to CUDDLE in that cave !
 1126|5|The movie Scarface is one of my all time favorite movies . It has a little bit of everything within the movie such as romance , friendship , suspense , and especially violence . I really enjoy violent movies and Scarface fits that criteria . Scarface shows how drugs and drug dealing are a major part of american culture .
11261|5|Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww !
11265|5|Stupid crude disgusting adolescent humor . I give it 5-stars .
 1127|5|Scarface . A classic . One of the best original gangsta movies of all time . I can never get tired of seeing it over and over again .
11278|5|This movie was way too funny . Rob rules .
 1128|5|Almost everyone has seen this movie . It is a legend . It was dramatic and suspenseful .
11281|5|FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY !
11286|5|I ENJOYED IT , IT WAS VERY FUNNY KEPT YOU GOING ALL DOING THE SHOW AND HAD VERY GOOD ACTORS MS . D .
11289|5|I thought this movie was soooo FUNNY ! I cant like explain myself why i liked it but its a must-see so just watch and see for yourself .
 1129|5|The movie was very real . It was an excellent portrayal of gang and drug life . NAS also makes references to the movie in his songs .
11292|5|This movie is very funny , from the beginning to the end . I saw the movie twice and it still was funny the second time . The humor is mostly bathroom humor and basically stuff that grosses you out . All the actors / actresses were very funny , especially Deuce's 'customers' .
  113|5|An excellent psychological thriller with fantastic acting .
 1130|5|Thi is one of my favorite movies . I like the Pacino , and the way he acts . He seems so real . I really like the story of how he went from a nobody to a big man and how it ends .
11300|5|very cute i loved it
11304|5|A very good remake of a very good series , Scooby-Doo has a talented cast with a variable script . Some of the jokes , including references to the television series , are great , while the fart jokes can be left at the door . Also , cameos from other characters and a great surprise ending make it a five-star . The deleted scenes on the DVD , however , were great and should have been left in !
11306|5|Zoiks . . . .
11309|5|Hey everyone ! Well , despite what oodie had to say I think that Scooby Doo was great ! And the kids in the audience were laughing quite histerically at the movie . . along with the adults . NO kid would rather the museum over Scooby Doo . . . I haven't watched the show in a long time and to go to the movies and see it was like seeing the cartoon characters in real life . The actors that partrayed these roles were great ! I mean , like Matthew Lillard . . . I never was too big of a fan of his , but in this role he was hilarious ! ! I remember one part where he said something I found myself laughing for like 20 minutes ahahaha . . I would go se the movie again just for that part . . haha okay well anyways . . Freddie Prince Jr . . Whoa baby ! ! Even with blonde hair he is a sexy papa ! And he was hilarious in this role too . . As were all of the actors . . Sarah Michelle Gellar was great ! I found myself laughing at her lot . . She was adorable in her the little purple dress he wore , but nehoo ! ! The woman who playes Thelma was great ! The movie was great ! Whoa ! I think I'm taking up too much space so I'm gonna go ! If anyone is in the mood for a funny lil movie then I suggest go see this ! : )
 1131|5|Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors . That movie has some of the best action for an early 80's picture . The character of Tony Montana was brilliant .
11314|5|His private life aside ( no pun intended ) this film was pretty good and funny . I thought his Saturday morning show was pretty funny too .
11315|5|i thought it was funny .
11316|5|Could be one of the best movies of all time . It has everything , good story line , and it's an adventure you won't forget .
11317|5|One of the most hilarious movies of the 80's ! I have only had the chance to see it twice , but someday will take the time to rent it again , or maybe even buy it . It is well worth the money . I thought this movie was done in great taste , and Pee Wee seemed so naive and innocent thru out the whole Big Adventure . Like most other reviewers on this website , there are so many scenes and lines that could never be forgotten , they are so memorable . I always hoped there would be a part 2 to this particular movie , but I guess it is best to leave well enough alone in this case . Or maybe there were plans for a second one until Pee Wee had fun with the willy ? Who knows ? But I certainly don't think Pee Wee should be condemned for enjoying masturbation , as it is natural . But he could have kept it in the bedroom , that is for sure . And like the Bee said , he isn't the only one in Hollywood who does these kinds of things , but Pee Wee just didn't get away with it .
 1132|5|Scarface is a classic . This has to be the all time best movie in history . The ending was tight . It would have been better if he blasted everyone though .
11320|5|This is an absolute classic .
11324|5|this movie was co-written with the late , great phil hartman . if you take it as a slapstick or other moron-oriented type of comedy , it will disappoint you , but if you look at it as a saga ( hang on ) and let it's funny moments become incidental , i promise you , you will recognize that this is one of the funniest movies that you have ever seen . geniuses like phil hartman , and , i daresay , paul rubens , don't feel pressure to entertain , and their punchlines are more subtly interwoven in their scripts , and rewardingly harvested . in other words , the characters can be jokes where in other comedies , dumb phrases carry the burden of entertaining the audience . i find it hard to believe that everybody on earth hasn't already seen this movie , but if you haven't , i recommend it whole-heartedly . it's one of the best i've ever seen .
11326|5|This movie may be rated PG , but the humor is definitely not geared toward children . Of course , neither was Pee Wee s Playhouse for the most part . One of the most creative , quirky and unique films ever made , Pee Wee s Big Adventure remains hilarious after 16 years . Many of the lines are burned in my memory not only from having watched this film many times but also because Pee Wee and this movie were so widely imitated at the time and well into the early 90 s . It s strange how some people seemed to forget how funny this movie was and how much they enjoyed it after Ruebens was caught attempting to cause himself to go blind in that Florida theater . Hugh Grant wasn t really doing much better than that himself once upon a time and it seemed to only boost his popularity . Hmmmmm . Well , I have no plans to marry either one of them , so I guess I m still free to enjoy their work .
11329|5|I loved this movie ever since I was a kid . I loved my bike too so I could relate to Pee-Wee .
 1133|5|Say hello to my little friend . If you don't know where that came from you are not from this planet . Whether you hated the movie or loved it you know that came from Tony Montana ( Al Pacino ) . This movie made everybody want to be Scarface . It has it all ; action , drama , and the American dream . A true movie masterpiece .
11330|5|This is among my favorite movies of all time . It has a ton of quotable lines , and is maybe the only Tim Burton movie where there's a personality at its center that overshadows the odd universe created by the director . Pee Wee ( There's things about me you wouldn't understand . . . things you couldn't understand . . . things you shouldn't understand ) is at his best in this movie . Francis , Dottie , Speck , Amazing Larry , they all rule . ( BTW , the biggest laugh I ever got out of a Mystery Science Theater episode came recently when someone quoted Pee Wee using that deep voice , Paging Mr . Herman , from the movie-within-the-movie near its end . )
11337|5|Laugh out loud funny . I'll never forget the Guacamole Treaty of 1917 . Falk and Arkin really clicked . I just about totally lost it when Billy or Bing , I don't remeber which , explained the use of the life vest in Chinese .
11338|5|THE IN-LAWS is a classic . Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are hilarious together . Just thinking of the word serpentine makes me laugh .
 1134|5|Tony Montana is played by Al Pacino . A great gangster movie of all time . Killing people , drug abuse , etc .
11340|5|This is the life story of Howard Stern . It is also one very funny movie . FOr those of us who like Howard , it is interesting to see how he worked his way up from obscurity to become the KING OF ALL MEDIA . FOr those of you who do not like Stern , this movie may give you some insight into his unique brand of humour . Great music throught the movie is an added bonous .
 1135|5|SEEMS SO REAL . I WISH I WAS SCARFACE MAKING MONEY .
11350|5|This movie was great ! A great flick for teens !
11364|5|this movie is touching and terrific
 1137|5|A 3 hour long Pacino saga that never gets old .
11377|5|Funny movie , you gotta love Jack Black
 1138|5|Scarface is a classic that will never die . It is the father of drug dealer movies .
11382|5|stab my foot with that pitchfork . . . OW , that didn't hurt . . . HAHA
 1139|5|Scarface is a classic . It will always be a great movie , no matter how many times I watch it .
11395|5|I loved this movie because the plot makes sence , Deniro and Crystal are hilarious , and has very , very funny parts .
  114|5|Anthony Hopkins did a great job as he always does . This is one of my favorite movies and i would highly recommend you to see it if you havent already .
 1140|5|Say hello to my little friend .
11414|5|I loved this book as a child and so I was thrilled when I found out they were remaking this film . It didn't disappoint at all . Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are at their best , hilarious and loving in a toned down sort of way . The child actors were all surprisingly good and distinct so that you felt like you knew all twelve . This is one of the best family films I've seen in a while . Wholesome and heart-warming , it does suffer a few slapstick , messy jokes but that just makes the kids happy . I definitely recommend it for the whole family .
11417|5|hysterical and cute !
 1142|5|Gets a little draggy at the end but still a great adventure Sean Connery film . Generally anything with Sam Neill , Scott Glenn and Sean Connery would be worth the watch . Baldwin appears to be sleep-walking .
11427|5|The people who dont get this movie are usually the Napoleon of their Home Town .
11429|5|My favorite thing that he says is frickin idot
11442|5|I loved this movie , You friggin idiots !
11444|5|Say what you want , but Jon Heder's 'Napoleon Dynamite' is very funny . What makes this movie so successful isn't so much the interaction of the seemingly cartoonish characters , but more the fact that the perennial underdogs ought to prevail despite the circumstances that should to overwhelm them . And it doesn't hurt that the picture is spliced with unforgettable supporting characters like Uncle Rico and Pedro , who feed about the humor throughout the film . All these make for a hilarious comedy which will bring loads of laughs to all movie-goers .
11447|5|The best movie ever besides Forrest Gump ! I loved it . Although it's not for everyone , people who enjoy comedy like Monty Python and Garden State will love it ! Go Tina the Llama !
11451|5|With a dearth of family movies out this summer , we took a gamble and took our kids ( ages 8 and 10 ) to it . Though it was PG , there was nothing really objectionable other than they said the word Crap now and then . The movie , kind of a dead-panned Revenge of the Nerds meets Judy Blume set in an Idaho High School , it was surprisingly funny ( my wife was in extreme stitiches ) . Napoleon ( played brilliantly by Jon Heder ) was hilarious . In fact , each character is delightfully absurd in their own way . I got a kick out of Dietrich Bader ( Otto from the Drew Carey Show ) ; he was my favorite as the wacko Sensei , Rex , who taught the lost martial art of Rex Kwon DO . Though I find most Indie films pretentious and way overhyped , not so with Napoleon Dynamite . It's an excellent film .
11452|5|One of the better independent films . I couldn't stop laughing the first time I saw it , and for no reason ! The second time it was just as great . I think only some will appreciate the slow , smart humor .
11453|5|best movie i ever saw funny as hell you must see it
11454|5|This was a wonderful movie . I saw it with my 15 yr old daughter and couldn't stop laughing ! The characters are wonderful . It is very refreshing without the usual violence and gratuitous sex scenes . Teenagers will love it , at least mine did . I may go see it again , I hear I missed something when I left during the end credits . Even from the opening credits , it was so creative and fun .
11455|5|Good characters , good story , and at least one catchphrase that I catch myself using . ( write that down )
11459|5|this film was very funny ! although it was descusting in parts wich made it that little bit funnier because everyone is like 'ewwwwww' ! i rented this on dvd and im now tempted to buy it !
11460|5|Love this movie !
11462|5|Animal House for the 90's
11463|5|Great movie . It was amazingly funny , but once again might upset those who dont like sexual humor or those who arent in the targeted highschool to college age groups .
11476|5|The Wedding Planner was one of the best movies that I have seen in while . It was full of good clean humor . It's a movie you can watch with anyone . . . I give it two thumbs up !
11480|5|A REAL romantic comedy . . . that's why I liked it so much . It's sweet , adorable and light . Afterwards , I didn't regret taking along my 6 year old . My husband liked it , too , except for the little white lies that the main characters tell . One more thing bothered him : the fact that I very easily convinced him to see this chick-flick not only once , but twice . And he liked it better the second time ! Same as I did .
11483|5|ohhhhh my gosh ! This was SUCH a great movie ! Jennifer Lopez was REALLY good in it . It was really romantic , yet funny . If you haven't seen it yet , do it NOW ! ! It was sooooo good !
11485|5|I loved this movie ! It was sooooo sweet , just in time for Valentine's Day ! I saw it on Sunday , and I Would gladly see it again . I bought the soundtrack , and it rocks too ! This movie is so cool !
11488|5|AWESOME MOVIE . . must see
11490|5|A sweet romantic comedy that uses wit and humour to create a universally appealing film . Not a sappy chick flick , and truly a funny comedy .
11491|5|Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey light up the screen in this delightful movie . The Wedding Planner is a fun-loving romantic comedy that's great for all audiences . Jennifer has a great sense of style and she brings it to the movie in full force . She plays Mary and did a wonderful job in her first comedic performance . Matthew is very charming and so funny . He did such a great job playing Steve . These two were perfectly cast for this movie . I've already seen this movie twice and still can't get it off my mind . I definitely will be buying this one when it's on DVD or VHS . Go out and see it . I promise you won't regret it ! !
11492|5|The Wedding Planner was the best movie that I have seen in a really long time ! Jennifer Lopez is a fantastic actress in this movie . Matthew McConaughey was also a great actor . The Wedding Planner is a Romantic Comedy and it made me laugh and cry . If you are thinking that this movie is not a chick flick , you're wrong because I watched it with my boyfriend who also loved it . It made me think about my own relationship and it helped so if you are having problems with your relationship , I suggest that you take your boyfriend to see this movie and I am sure that everything will be fine after that . I could see this movie over and over and over again and I can't wait until it comes out on VHS so I can buy it . Instead of watching the Super Bowl on Sunday , I went to see The Wedding Planner and that is something that I will never regret . So go out and see it ! ! !
11494|5|When I saw this movie the first time I was disappointed . It seemed just too stupid to me . Up watching it the second time I thought it was really funny . I accepted it for what it was , stupid humor , and now it's one of my favorite movies . Damn that Hansel ! He's so hot right now !
11496|5|Ben Stiller's best movie I think , I like it because it is so stupid and it relly makes fun of the fashion industry which in itself is a big joke . There are a lot of celebrity cameos as well . its funny because the guy has the same face for every single modelling shoot , and then the face he has been working on for years is also the same pose ! ! ben stiller's entire family works on the film ( wife , dad , and mom ) and i had to have laughed the entire way through , every time i watch it !
11498|5|So funny ! ! ! Stiller and Owen Wilson are incredibly funny . I wouldn't give the movie a chance because I heard it was about male modeling , but after i stumbled into it , I just couldn't stop watching it . Anyone can die in a freak gasoline fight accident .
 1150|5|A true Cold War classic ! Sean Connery shines , Alec is OK , even Sam Neill had a good role . Me being in the Navy , I had to be partial to this movie as it keeps you on the edge of your seat .
11506|5|LOVE THIS MOVIE HILARIOUS AND FUNNY LOVE IT ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES !
 1151|5|A great movie . One I can turn on and enjoy watching anytime .
11512|5|This was even funnier than the first one , and the first one was a blast .
11516|5|hilarious . . . . . this is a masterpiece of comedy . . . . . loved the first movie . . . . and loved the second
11518|5|I enjoyed this sequal very much . It was just as good as the first . I was bit dubious about the sequel but it was done really well . It helped haveing all the original people in it as the film could jump straight into the story . very funny jokes and heart warming at the end as all things were tied in . A must see !
11520|5|I enjoyed American Pie 2 . The sequel to this teenage comedy , seemed to have more heart than the first one , where everything was about teenagers and their wild adventures . Don't get me wrong , the sequel had the same expected humour impact , but a bit more sensitive . If you thought you got to know the characters really well in the previous movie , this one actually goes deeper into their true feelings and exhibits their emotions at a better level conclusive level . By the end of the film you know that American Pie 2 provided a close to all characters and relationships , therefore making it very hard for a next sequel . Overall , I was pretty satisfied , and even surprised with the outcome of American Pie 2 , since I had much lower expectations from it .
11545|5|An instant classic !
11548|5|The original Amercan Pie . Laugh out loud hilarity .
11550|5|Haven't seen this movie in years but I do remember laughing my butt off .
11552|5|This is a fun movie throughout that I can watch over and over . Too bad the sequels were all so horrible .
11555|5|Hillarious !
 1156|5|I really enjoyed this movie . It attracted me because my dad is a submariner . He said it was very realistic . It was very dramatic and there was never a dull moment .
11563|5|All about three men getting involved with a baby that was left on their steps . They get very attached despite being wild bachelors .
 1157|5|Excellent , Excellent , Excellent movie ! ! ! Sean Connery in one of his absolute finest performances . This definitely is one of the best submarine battle movies ever made .
11573|5|LOVED ITTTTT ! ! ! ! !
 1158|5|This is an absolutely brilliant film adaptation of an absolutely brilliant novel . In my opinion this is the best action movie ever made .
11582|5|My favorite movie of all time : Richard Pryor , George Carlin , Bill Duke , Antonio Huggy Bear Fargus ( what a cast ! ) . A killer sound track by Rose Royce . The Pointer Sisters . C'mon Dog , what's not to like about this movie ! ?
11585|5|Excellent movie . Great original story and well acted . Something different from your typical Hollywood movie .
11588|5|funny , original - about a girl who decides to try out being gay for a while ! asks the question about the differences between love between a couple and love between best friends , is this film the line between platonic and sexual is moved
11589|5|I loved this movie , cute and funny . Ashley Judd & Hugh Jackman had great chemistry . . .
 1159|5|It was a good movie because of the great acting of Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin , with nice plot .
11596|5|great movie . .
11597|5|This movie was so cute . I cried at the end . Once again , Hugh Jackman's talent shines like the brightest star in the sky . Ashley Judd is such a good actress . Go see the movie as soon as you can . It was one of the best made yet .
11599|5|one of my favorite movies . . . . . . . . . . just wanna hang out . . . . . . . . no big deal
11602|5|i liked it i thoght it was a pretty funny movie .
11603|5|Well , I thought it was funny . I did actually have a similar ( not as intense or long ) situation with someone who turned my cable on for a fee .
11610|5|Love it !
11612|5|I didn't see the play , didn't read the play . But I thought this story was hilarious . I'm buying the video .
11618|5|Outstanding film , I saw it at opening night of the Denver International Film Festival . This one will keep you rolling in the ailes ! The acting is supperb all the way around . William H Macy should be up for a best actor nomination . Too bad this has a limited distribution since it is the best movie I've seen all year .
11619|5|I loved Rob Schnieder ( is that how u spell it ? ) in this movie he was awesome ! ! ! ! ! !
 1162|5|Ok everyone gather round' while i tell u a tale a tale of the legend of John Rambo . Rambo ( Stallone ) was a vietnam war hero veteran , who during war saw all his friends get annahilated . He had no family and nowhere to go , the war vets were thought of as baby killers and other vile crap . Rambo went to visit his old budy that survived but wouldnt you know it , cancer ate him down to the bone , so having nowhere to go he heads for Bumtown ( Portland ) on his way there he gets picked up for vagrancy in a small jerkwater town by the sheriff . As u can guess Rambo didnt want a ride outta town so they booked him for resisting arrest . they take him in and " F " with the wrong guy , he escapes and heads up into the forest and hides out up there while everyone and their dogs ( literally ) hunt his ass down . But big John is hard to find ( War experience ) well i dont want to give away the ending so go see this if you havnt , before Rambo comes for you ! ! ! " he drew first blood " .
11620|5|this movie was the best . . . cant get 2 much better . . . You see this artifact ? Look , there's a secret compartment for your weed right here . See this other artifact , here's the compartment for your weed again .
11626|5|even tho its not out yet that movie lookz so funny . . ima go see it ! ! !
11629|5|I could actually picture cops doing stuff like that on their downtime . The feud between the highway cops and the state cops was good for laughs . As far as the movie itself goes I wouldn't call it useless because it entertained me and everyone that I have shared it with .
 1163|5|You better run cause Big John Rambo is on the loose and is pissed of at that hick town and the damn sheriff . watch out cause Rambo has his own war and he didnt draw first blood . this is an excellent outdoor film that makes you thirsty for revenge and blood . stallone should have won an Oscar , best movie of that year as well . " he drew first blood ! ! ! "
11634|5|If you like the subtle absurdities of Rushmore and the Royal Tenenbaums , Bottle Rocket is a must see . This is before the other two , and best captures Andersons style . It had me laughing my arse off . Then again , if you're not a fan of Wes Anderson or the Wilson brothers , you may just find it boring . Definitely worth renting , though .
11636|5|i love it i own it on dvd . Catherine zeta-jones is amazing and soooo beautiful
11638|5|Loved the characters , actors , and thought it was extremely funny . It's kind of the way I think the real Hollywood is . It made me laugh .
 1164|5|This is the best stallone movie ! one of the best action movies ever , amazing story also , you better go rent this one at blockbuster before its gone .
11647|5|Funny funny funny . Oh , I forgot . . . funny ! I thought the cinema would have crumpled down because of the big laughs in the crowd .
11648|5|This was awesome ! i loved the scene with the burning . . . well watch and find out
11650|5|Hysterical ! Very funny and witty . The cast was terrific and the writers knew how to make people laugh .
11653|5|every movie with david spade is a very funny movie i loved it it was a great and very funny movie plus brittany daniels is so hot .
11656|5|There haven't been hardly any funny movies out in the last few years , but this one is hilarious . And I didn't think David Spade could be funny without Chris Farley . . . boy was I wrong . Definitely a must-see .
 1166|5|east or west sylvester stallone is the best
11662|5|An all right film , and Kidman saves it from being a dud .
11663|5|Underrated terribly . Totally hilarious .
11667|5|Hysterical ! ! ! So cute ! LOVED IT .
11678|5|Ok , I wouldn't give it five stars , except that I'm comparing it to a lot of new comedy releases . Anyway , this movie was hilarious . To actually think about a sweet old lady driving a seemingly normal couple to such extremes , even makes me laugh now . I haven't had so many laugh out loud moments watching a comedic movie in years . It's a must see .
 1168|5|Stallone's finest hour .
11682|5|Again , it's not really a comedy . But it's a great fable about modern politics - specifically the beauty and depravity of human nature amplified through the tempest of politics . As dark as the film seems , its really about mixed motives and the tension between idealism and cynicism , romance and realism , and principle and pragmatism . Its billed as a slam of the Clintons , but actually the portrayals are very humanizing in that there are in fact strong core values obscured by the hypocrisy and corruption . I actually came away liking the Clintons more . Emma Thompson was as usual just dazzling in her versatility , but Travolta really impressed me despite the stereotypical depiction . I actually forgot that I was looking at Travolta , whereas Im usually annoyed with him half way through the film because he normally inserts too much of his own personality into his characters . The supporting cast was superb right down to the minor characters with one or two lines .
11686|5|Best movie ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
11688|5|Great movie , i still laugh every time i watch it . I help plan http : / / www . montrealvip . com / bachelor . htm wild bachelor parties for a living , and this movie has been a great insperation . I have even seen guys bring the moive to watch durring durring their BP . I'm still trying to find a doneky , but its hard in downtown Montreal : )
 1169|5|I remember when this first came out and there was nothing but rave reviews . I still think it was a great movie . The best the Stallone has ever done .
11693|5|Thatv was so00o funny ! especially wit Chris Rock in it ! He'S dA BoMb ! ! i LoVe RiChArD 4 lYf ! ! ! !
11694|5|This movie was hilarious ! It wasn't the funniest movie of all time or anything , but it is definately worth seeing . Great entertainment !
11695|5|I seen this movie last weekend , and it was so funny chris rock is hillarious . When he is the old man it is so funny . You will like this movie cause i sure did .
11697|5|hilarious stifler at his best if he wasent in there the movie wouldnt be funny at all I really liked it .
11698|5|I just seen this movie for the first time last night and . . . WOOHOO ! ! ! I am very glad they made the last installment of American Pie as funny as the original . When Stifler ( Scott ) has to eat that dog sh * t , I just about pissed in my pants .
  117|5|One of the best movies I have ever seen . Anthony Hopkins did a fantastic job along with Jody Foster
 1170|5|One of Stallones best films behind the Rocky films
 1171|5|This story has a moral to it , SF Veterans should not be messed around with . Sly was awesome and the town got totally F'D up , that sherif was a prick , and Trautmans uniform was ALL wrong . But oh well i didnt catch it the fist few times .
11718|5|Wife made me watch it with her . I confess , I liked it . Paltrow did a nice job acting the part of an average IQ person determined to rise from the ranks of her low-class upbringing . I liked her struggle and how she ended up as a pilot . Maybe because I have two daughers and a beautiful wife , I can appreciate a film that encourages women and girls to accomplish , have high standards , and behave ethically . Girls need this kind of role model . Wife says it's a girl power movie . I thought it was great !
11727|5|Connie and Carla was great ! A lot of new movies , trends , music , etc are all becoming some what the same . This new movie sensation was something that was actually NEW ! You must go out and see something that you'd be missing ! Aren't you bored of almost every movie having the same actors , plot , climax , etc ?
11732|5|I luv this movie . It is really awesome just like Bring it on !
11744|5|That was a great movie ! especially wit FrEdDy PrInZe Jr . in it ! NoW hE'S a HoT'n'SeXy MaMa ! i LoVe RiChArD 4 lYf ! ! ! !
11748|5|This is among the most underrated comedies of all time . This was a LOL riot all the way through . When they're not too busy partying off camera , Norm Macdonald and Ardie Lange can be comedic geniuses ( SNL , MADTV , Howard Stern Show ) . ONce you get to the bar scene , the laughter never ends .
11749|5|Very underappreciated comedy of the '90's . Norm MacDonalad is superb .
11768|5|Trey and Matt have struck gold once again . Now don't go into this one expecting Shakespeare or clean , wholesome , or otherwise safe family entertainment ( yeah , you know who you are ) . Never in my life have I laughed so hard in a theatre , nor have I ever been to a movie that got such an overwhelming reaction of chestpain-inducing laughter from everyone in attendance . The audience reaction was so overwhelming that it was at difficult to hear the dialogue at times . Parker and Stone are right on the money in their criticisms of all sides of the war on terror : everything , from kneejerk patriotism to Hollywood's delusions that they can change the world with their acting and how the rest of the world gets caught in the crossfire . Their representation of Sean Penn's Iraq visit reminiscence is spot on . Just like South Park , this work is far more intelligent than meets the eye . Parker and Stone have further perfected their formula of taking a relatively serious issue , hitting it with a dash of clever political commentary , and then giving it a generous ladling of tacky sauce . It works every time . The peons who can't see past the bathroom humor and get to the meat of what these guys are trying to say should go back to their American Idols , their Bachelors , and their Apprentices .
11770|5|Gigantic artistic effort . Wonderful satire of the Hollywood 'activists' & has a sing-along soundtrack as good as 'South Park : Bigger , Longer , Uncut . ' Can't wait for the DVD . One caveat : If U love the cannibalistic deranged torturers who run North Korea , maybe it is not for U .
 1178|5|This movie is great , it gave Sylvester Stallone his first break to be a shooting star . It also gets into the controversial idea of sacrificing your life for your country , but all the system does is shaft you in return .
11787|5|hilarious . not many comedys are anything like this . if your in the mood for a good laugh with something different . then watch it somehow . i wish they would hurry up with that sequel .
11789|5|Although not up to par of TV's Frasier or I Love Lucy or the cinematic genius of Toy Story 2 or Airplane ! , it is certainly a funny movie that is easily enjoyable . Sight gags , word puns , product placement , modern references , and funny sound effects round out a great plot with a hilarious ending . And , the sequel is really in the planning stages ! Let's hope the evil Betty doesn't team up with Moon-You again . . .
 1179|5|The one that started it all . It leaves you with a sense of unfinished business . Stallone is crazy and you'll know why if you see this .
11794|5|john goodman at his best
11795|5|that was probably the FUNNIEST movie i ever saw .
11798|5|was pleasnatly surprised how the movie turned out ! ! was very entertained and thought it was David spades best so far
  118|5|This movie is so great . The scenes between Lecter and Clarice are so intense , you can actually feel it . Some will be turned off by the subject matter , but the ones who stay with it will not be disappointed . I don't want to give too much away .
11801|5|Most of these pieces were brilliant and hilarious , although I started to feel wired just watching the characters down the coffee !
11807|5|INCREDIBLE ! May have even bumbped Fight Clug from my top fave spot . I'll have to see the back to back , once I get the Huckabees DVD . HIGHLY RECOMMEND ! LOVE THE MUSIC BY JON BRION as well . PERFECT for the movie !
11811|5|I hope they will make a 3 . Eddy Murphy was terrific , as well as the animals . I even went out and bought the movie .
11815|5|I thought this movie was very very good , it was hilarious . Frankie Muniz and Mandy Moore did the voice of two bear cubs . Eddie Murphy did a great job and the movie had a little surprise that you have to think about for a minute before it registers what happened , if you go and see it I think you will know what I'm talking about .
11825|5|I LOVED this movie
 1183|5|Any film where the makers had the balls to name a villainess " Pussy Galore " deserves 5 stars on principle !
11834|5|Love it !
11835|5|Under-rated film that is destined to earn a cult following in the future .
11839|5|I am in Total agreement with all the users that wrote that they enjoyed this movie , because I did too ! , but come on now , Tara Reid , Parker Posey , and Alan Cummings should win an Oscar ? That seems a little bit much ! While the previously mentioned trio did steal the show , I think Oscar talk is a little silly for this kind of movie . It makes you laugh , which is what this kind of movie is supposed to do . As mentioned before , Tara Reid steals the show with such HILLARIOUS lines as The walls are mushy ! , If I could go back in time . . . I would meet Snoopy ! , I know what we can do . . . raise money for a search party , and organize a bake sale ! and my person favorite But wouldn't it be cool if you could be in two rooms at once . . . I could be in here . . . AND over there ! I could be in my room , and in the living room , and in the bathroom , and my closet , and back in my bathroom . . . and back in the living room ! Just makes you giggle ! Too bad it wasn't a big success at the box office !
 1184|5|Definitely one of the 3 best Bond movies and probably the most iconic viz the golden girl and Bond on the laser table . Goldfinger himself is also probably the best of the super villains
11842|5|Hey ! I loves this movie ! I have no idea why really because it's not like I want to be a musician when I grow up , but I do love music ! Maybe it's the idea a punk GIRL group instead of all these punk BOY groups . I also like lepoard print ! There's just something about this movie that really makes me think It's da bomb ! . I know my mom doesn't agree with me but who cares . She's a grown up ! I'm a kid , so I have a right to like it ! That's all ! C ya later !
11848|5|Loved it !
 1185|5|My favorite Bond film . it just had so many bests - best car , best henchman , best name ( Miss Galore ) , best Bond .
11854|5|A very funny movie to see .
 1186|5|Excellent entertainment value . Still enjoy watching it , though I have seen it many times . Very stylish with a good cast . Gert Forbes isn't one of the better Bond villians , but he is still good . Odd-Job is still scary . Pussy Galore makes most A list actresses today look like cardboard cut-outs in comparism .
 1187|5|Very exciting movie with the best Bond song ever . Shirley Bassey really belted out the lyrics .
11874|5|I happen to love the stupid stereotypes- even the affirmative actionone ! I thought it was past time someone did a send-up of those stupid blaxploitation race movies ! gets on soapbox If people would develop a sense of humor about our percieved differences- and not be so [ expletive deleted ] hypersensative- we would be in a lot better shape as a people . this movie is a step in the right direction . steps down off soapbox thank you . . .
11875|5|It was funny and witty . I enjoyed it very much .
11877|5|hilarious watch it . do it do it
11883|5|This movie is hilarious . I love the outbursts by Robin Williams . Bastard son of Barney . You illegenament Telli-Tubbey .
11884|5|i thought this movie was great . i expected it to suck , like everyone else did , but it's so funny , in a dark sort of way . It made me laugh a lot . A great look into the cutthroat world of Children's entertainment . Makes yoou think what kind of Bribes Barney must have been taking during his supreme reign . . .
 1189|5|Goldfinger ( the third film in the James Bond film franchise released in 1964 ) marks the point where the series reaches cruising altitude and speed . All of the now expected elements are here : suave , lady-killer Bond ( Sean Connery ) , Q's gadgets ; Batmobilish automobile , tongue-in-cheek puns , and a killer theme song by Shirley Bassey . One also gets the feeling that Goldfinger ( Gert Frobe ) is every bit the equal of 007 , though on the dark side . Goldfinger is the first in the series in which Bond has any real and extended interaction with his chief nemesis resulting in a richer film and better character development . The movie also introduces the exotic sidekick with Oddjob ( which was revisited in The Man With The Golden Gun ( 1974 ) ) and returns to using intriguing names for the primary Bond Girl in the form of Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore . The only real complaint with this film is the real time editing problem near the end of the movie when Bond is blindly trying to defuse a bomb as a nuclear scientist rushes down the steps to do it himself .
11893|5|It reminded me of goofy time with my girlfriends talking about the love we longed for and the laughs we had . I thought it was really cool . I love Cameron Diaz .
11899|5|Another great comedy that I could watch over and over again and never get tired of it . Denise Richards at her best ! Highly recommended !
  119|5|A movie that put Johnathan Demme on the map . It might've been too grizzly in nature to win Best Picture ( oddly , a whole year and a month after its release ) but with riveting perfomrances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster , this movie couldn't have never been ignored .
 1190|5|best bond movie
11903|5|I've seen this movie 2 times already . I went once with my good friend , then once with my two best guy friends , and they even loved it . It's a really really well done sequel , and I'd definetly buy it when it comes out .
11917|5|Great actresses who made an interesting story really fun . I enjoyed it a lot .
11936|5|This was a great surprise to me as well as my daughter . I don't really like Katie Holmes movies , and have her stereotyped in my own mind to Dawson's Creek , but April was a very well done film . I think that it will fall through the cracks as it is more of an 'art type' film , but I would recommend it to everyone , give it a chance .
 1194|5|The best of the Bond movies . Shirley Bassey sang the theme song brilliantly .
11940|5|I am not a particular fan of Tom Hanks , but I have to say he really impressed me in this one . That giggle was brilliant , I thought I'd die laughing . I had no idea that this was a remake , but no matter how good the original was , this version certainly can match it . The Coens are great . Of course , it is not the traditional Hollywood comedy , but thats whats so great about it . Wayans was very criticised , I really dont understand why , I thought he was excellent . The scene when he remembers his childhood is even worthy of Quentin Tarantino . I enjoyed this film a lot .
11944|5|Hilarious movie . Although a little bit of an older crowd in the theater i was in , everybody was laughing throughout the movie . Hanks was great as usual , Marlon Wayans was extremely funny , and all the other supporting actors were very good . Gets an R rating for frequent use of the F Bomb by Wayans , but otherwise a very good comedy .
 1195|5|Shirley Eaton is fabulous .
11955|5|This was about the funniest movie I've ever seen . EVERY scene was funny . Intricate plot , clever dialogue , excellent acting , great cinematography and well written . This deserves to be much higher on the list , my guess is that it's new and many people haven't yet seen it . Highly recommended !
11959|5|Oh man , we used to watch this movie so often in college during those hazy late nights after being out . I remember seeing the movie in the theaters with my folks and sister when I was a kid and I loved it then and still do . So many big name actors got their 'start' in this movie . Plot line is how the Japanese are trying to find Hollywood to bomb it in the year of 1941 . Great comedy . Slim Pickens has a great role in this movie ( short one , but great ) . 'Delicious , nutritious carmel coated popper snacks ! ! ! ' I am not the biggest fan of Ferris wheels to this day because of a particular scene in the movie . 'See this grapefruit ? I think it's rotten . Yep , it's rotten I'm going to throw it . It's going , it's going , it's going , it's going , it's going . . . . it's gone' . I cannot tell you how many girls a buddy of mine and myself annoyed in college at parties and bars when we would shake imaginary grapefruits and recite that line . I guess this review does not give too much insight into the movie , just shows that this was one of those movies that happened to be a favorite of mine for a particular period of time . I am not sure what other people think about it , but just thinking about it now makes me want to go and rent it tonight .
11961|5|I thought that this movie showed all kinds of genres and was very entertaining . It might be more of a chick flick because it was more emotional , but everyone did a great job on it ! Must see !
11963|5|This was independent film gone wild . I'm told that most of the characters really were living in Austin .
11966|5|No Movie will ever be as great as this one
11968|5|Hilariously funny
 1197|5|the best bond movie ever
11976|5|HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HAHA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA ! HA !
   12|5|Adventure , Religion , Nazis being vaporized , Serpants , cryptology . . . This movie inspired me on SO many levels .
  120|5|anthony hopkins was truly amazing in this movie . . his voice was really freaky . he really deserved the oscar . . it was really scary and it was made beautifully from the book . . much better than its sequel
12001|5|I haven't seen this movie . But , I saw a lot of ads for it . And I think it looks pretty good . Mandy Moore is a good actress anyway . But this movie really takes teenage life in a whole different way . She's afraid of love until a special man comes into her life . I like the story line .
12002|5|I love this movie ! It teaches people that popularity isn't everything . I loved it !
12003|5|I loved this movie ! It showed that being popular isn't a must . Its cute and a lot like the world today
12004|5|Almost as funny as the original . Great cast : Dre , Eminem , Snoop , George Wallace , Shaq , Ludakris . A great follow up ( 25 yrs . later ) to one of the great comedies of my time ( Car Wash )
12006|5|Chessy story but very hillarious ! Anyone who has liked the movie Dumb and Dumberer or anyone that likes classic tv shows would like this comedy .
12007|5|The ultimate date movie . This little-known laugh riot only lasted in theatres maybe one week before going straight to video and cable . Love Stinks makes Fatal Attraction look like a ride at Disneyland . The humor is raunchy at times--but every zinger is so intelligently written that you can't help but get absorbed by the chemistry shared between the beautiful , but oh-so possessive Bridgette Wilson and the nice guy pushed too far antics of French Stewart ( from T . V . 's 3rd Rock ) Of course , the true lovers of this flick will be the ones that have first-hand experience of bitter break-ups .
12011|5|that was FUNNY !
12015|5|Funnies thing Adam Sandler has done in a long time . Kudos to him .
12021|5|Ohhh man I've been pimpin since been pimpin , since been pimpin' funny junk !
12023|5|For all it being stupid and dumb , I really , really enjoyed this movie ! I couldn't stop laughing . It is stupid and dumb and insane , yt somehow it manages to work . Ashton is great in this flick . Taken as a a work of art , it really isn't that good of a movie . Simple and predictable plot , bathroom humour and lously acting . Usually this means a diaster , but with this film , it somehow works . One of the first DVD's IJR bought when I got my dvd player . A classic !
 1204|5|um . . . . . . brilliant !
12041|5|I thought this film was totally hilarious ! I only watched it cos my brother got it for Christmas , and I expected it to be totally pants , but I loved every minute of it , I have never laughed so much at one film . And of course , it has the gorgeous Ashton in it . . .
12046|5|Very funny
 1205|5|I admit , you have to be a little twisted to like this movie , but that's the shear JOY of it for fans that appreciate it . . . It's twistedness that is .
12050|5|This was so funny ! Sure maybe a little sick at times , but I still love it !
12053|5|I love this movie in fact it is my favorite movie ever ! ! ! At first all of my friends wanted to see it and i thought it looked soooo stupid , but i rented it and loved it , it's kinda bad though , like the whole concept they run into i bisexual stripper , go to a strip club , touch girl's hoo hoos and well other , stuff it's funny though
12061|5|AAAAHAHAHAHAHA ! i thought this movie was soooo funny . some parts were like really fake though , but it was still funny . i would recomend this to anyone who has a sence of humor !
12071|5|I loved The Animal . When I went to see it , I was expecting yet another pointless comedy with no real storyline and a lot of bad jokes . I was surprised to discover that , while this movie is definately a comedy , it also had some depth and some serious moments . I couldn't help but feel sorry for Marvin , the police officer wannabe who cannot seem to do anything right . He was a well thought out character , with some depth that is unusual for a comedy . Five stars !
12076|5|this movie was hilarious ! ! !
 1208|5|I love this movie . The cast is phenomenal , the dialog is very entertaining , and the storyline is too cool . One of Tarantinos 3 best ( True Romance and Resevoir Dogs being the other 2 ) . And yes , I am a little twisted . LOL
12088|5|ya great movie
 1209|5|tarantino is unique when it comes to his movies . he casts those that are perfect for their roles and you could never imagine anyone else playing the part . this gave john travolta a comeback that was never expected to happen and it showed how much talent and ability to play other parts
12092|5|this is the best movie of all time . . . morris chestnut looked sooo sexy . . . i wish i was playing in that movie with him . . . vivica fox did an excellent job in the movie also . . . she is the best actress of all time ! ! ! ! !
12100|5|this is a great movie . I ust got the DVD and it has a lotof extra scenes and a commentary by the director . You can really see what the movie was meant to be before the editors got at it .
12103|5|I could not have had a more different experience with this movie than Shroomwoman . I loved this flick . Seeing the movie billed as a comedy and seeing that Steve Martin was the lead , I was expecting a light , Roxanne-like movie that might be good for a couple of laughs . What I got was the bizarre , dark little movie about a complacent dentist ( Martin ) who makes a couple of bad decisions , and sees his life spiral out of control . While there are funny scenes , this movie is in NO way a comedy . Think Donnie Darko , not The Jerk . There were some outstanding performances by bit parts - Scott Caan as the villain , Kevin Bacon as the movie star doing research for a murder mystery film , and of course Laura Dern . This is a weird , creepy , dark , bizarre little movie - strongly recommended if you like that kind of thing .
12105|5|This is a first rate comedy . Never has a vamp's power over men of all kinds been more hillariously portrayed than in this film . I loved it start to finish !
 1211|5|Obviously one of the greatest , but definitly it won't appeal to all people . This is cleary a dialogue movie , meaning that most of the movie consists of just dialogue , whether in a car , at a house , or at a bar . But don't get the wrong impression from this . There is great action at the right times and there are a huge amount of famous actors / actresses in this film . Definitly not my favorite , but right up there .
12111|5|I seen this movie when i was about 12 years old . Funny movie ! Even more funnier today since i am older and understand it more . Probably the only movie i like to watch with Howie Mandel or Ted Danson . I was amased how young Dennis Franz looks . People who like the movie Dumb and Dumberer probably would like this movie . Some of the movies that are considered bad are the funniest movies . It is a movie you got to relax and watch .
12113|5|LOVED it ! ! A Laff Riot ! ! ! ! !
12120|5|I would normally give this one 4 stars , but I'm giving 5 because everyone else seems to be bashing it so badly . I liked it . I can see though how some fundamentalist types might be upset by the Dantean-Catholic-newage vision of the heaven / hell mythos . The thing that was funniest to me at the time was the running gag about how saintly Henry Winkler was ! I remember Henry as the badass Fonzie in Happy Days anyone else old enough to remember the contreversy about that character ? How times have changed !
12126|5|This movie is so stupid , but so , so funny . It's such a relief to see that Rodney Dangerfield is still acting and in this case still funny . Adam Sandler is his usual dumb character , this time Nicky , the son of the devil who is sent to find his 2 brothers who have just broken out of hell . Cameos , cameos . Jon Lovitz and Henry Winkler show up in funny cameo roles .
 1214|5|I have watched this film countless times and I never get tired of it . Quentin Tarantino's characters and dialogue are second to none .
 1215|5|Such intelligent and sophisticated direction is perfectly complimented by Quentin Tarantino's masterful screenwriting . Nobody turns a phrase quite like the Knoxville native . This is by far the most popular film he's ever directed and yet it may not even be the best . In Pulp Ficiton he takes what he did in Reservoir Dogs with unchronological story telling and refines it beautifully . Reservoir Dogs my be the more exciting of two , but this one is more concise and important . Best Scene : Jules Winfield's pre-killing monologue .
 1216|5|Gets better every time I see it .
12161|5|This movie isn't going to win any awards , but I think it was a cute movie .
 1217|5|Quinten Tarantino has a way to create a story , make it go backwards , than flip it upside-down , and make you want to rant and rave about it for the rest of your existance . Out of the few movies he has made this is my favorite . And I will strike down with great vengenance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers . And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengance apon thee . -Pulp Fiction
12184|5|if u look at the case of the movie then you probly will think it looks retarded but the storyline is different then u would think it is .
 1219|5|one of the top five greatest films ever ! ! ! ! ! and if you did not getit you are an idiot !
12195|5|If you loved the first one you'll love this one . I thought a sequel would suck but I was wrong , it was hilarious , I haven't laughed that much at a movie in a long time .
  122|5|great movie ! full of suspense . well acted ( anthony hopkins is awsome ! ) and well directed . Who knew a film about canabalism whould be a hit . definitly recomended !
12207|5|I thought it was very good . Had a good story . It was funny and even made me cry ! Not really all that much of a chick flick either !
12231|5|best movie ever .
12235|5|I guess once again I'm in the minority here . Tomcats had me in stitches . It's one of the raunchiest comedies I've ever seen .
 1225|5|One of my favorite Quentin Tarentino films , next to Kill Bill and Reservior Dogs .
12258|5|worst movie ever . loved it .
12259|5|I am sorry but I have watched this movie over 20 times and I laugh every time . Daddy would you like some sausage ? and The backwards man . is hysterical ! ! ! For those of you who find this offensive . . . LIGHTEN UP ! ! ! It is just a movie and Tom Green just tries to get the audience to laugh at any cost .
12261|5|it was awesome- playing with a dead antelope- al I can say is- he's pure genious ! lol
12262|5|tom green is the best
12266|5|hehhe , loved this movie , couldnt stop laughing . 5 stars greatest movie ever oscar winner wooo
 1227|5|Yet again , another film by Tarintino seeping with style and finesse . His editing and storylines are absolutely seamless - he effortlessly moves the plot from the past to the present , from one characters perspective to another to the point where its a work of art . And Samuel Jackson just radiates cool .
12270|5|Simply genious !
 1228|5|I loved it .
12286|5|Ishtar is en extremly funny movie . It is a real spoof of Lawrence Of Arabia-type movies , and it really does work in spots . It is pretty goofy and the scripts got confusing , but it's pretty funny .
12292|5|One of the best Tom Green movies and one of my all time favourites . Its hilarious . Its about a guy who promises his niece that she would pay her tuition to Harvard , but also promises his fiancee to buy a house . He tries to make them both happy by spending his savings on a house and tries to think of a way to get $ 20000 for his niece with his friend Duff played by Tom Green . Needless to say . . . hilarity ensues !
12311|5|The nonfiction much-written-about events of this movie were not at all new to me , yet the impact of seeing 'End of the Spear' was fresh , heart-piercing , motivating , and if ever the word should be used : poignant , that's what it was , poignant . U . S . missionaries in Ecuador seek out unreached cannibalistic Waodani tribe and are killed by them , and that's the beginning . Family members of missionaries then go to live with the tribe which then places trust in Christ . This redemption movie is told thru the eyes of a killed missionary's son . Highly recommend for Christians--don't know about nonChristians , they might find the concept absurd . For ex , when the son as a kid asked his dad if they would shoot the Waodani if attacked , the dad said , " Son , we can't shoot the Waodani , they're not ready for heaven , we are . " ( Well-done and beautiful film , but suspend disbelief as regards the failure of makeup to show aging of characters over decades . )
12312|5|This movie was really funny . You know how you see a commercial for a comedy , you go see the movie , and you realize that all the funny parts were in the preview ? This is not one of those movies . The whole thing is good from beginning to end . Great Characters , Great story .
12313|5|This was an excellent movie . Okay , Travolta calls up the same corny southern accent he used in Primary Colors . But it's refreshing to watch a film that assumes that you're literate , and promotes learning as a virtue . The colors and the emotions of the cinematography is overwhelming . Later , when Katrina hit , I found myself wondering what happened to that house . Great performances by all .
12315|5|Little red riding hood is a crapy a hole
12316|5|jodie foster . brilliant , as always .
12318|5|I recently saw this movie with some friends . This movie is edge-of-you-seat yet still is an interesting story where you want to know what happens and is not corny like some action thrillers . I highly reccomend it
12320|5|It's really a shame the series couldn't survive the lowest common denominator of ratings . Anything written by someone with a 3 figure IQ will probably die an early death on today's television , unless it earns some notoriety like the religious one everybody is freaking out about .
12321|5|all the right elements are in the mix : the pace is fast without being confusing , the humor dry and witty , the action exciting and suspenceful . if anything is missing its the over-blown ( and obvious ) computer graphics and clich � � s of a doomed futuristic world that have become the standard for sci-fi ( or any other summer blockbuster , for that matter ) . rather , this is an actual story of people with complicated pasts and uncertain futures ; it just happens to be set in outer space . this movie should become the touchstone for all movies , but especially sci-fi , wherein the focus is on how each particular person -- in keeping with his character -- reacts to the action and environment .
12322|5|Incredible movie . Works best for fans of the 'Firefly' series , but the movie should be thoroughly enjoyable for almost any fan of sci-fi . The character development and writing is miles ahead of what George Lucas has done with the Star Wars series since 'The Empire Strikes Back' . Deserves a shot @ becoming a franchise . . .
12323|5|Serenity employs an ingenious opening sequence to catch up viewers who are uninitiated in the Firefly 'verse , and then , in the words of River Tam , " I know . We're going for a ride . " A thrilling ride . As in his other work , Joss Whedon uses an intricate mix of genres , high drama , action , mystery , humor , and character driven plot to draw the viewer into his world , and then keep the audience on the edge of their seats for the next two hours . Serenity is scifi for the thinking person , where the knuckle-whitening action is there to serve the development of its characters , and the laugh out loud moments let you catch your breath almost in time to gasp in shock . At the same time , the story works on the deeper level of analogy important to all great scifi , commenting on the human need for freedom , for family , for something to believe in , and the willingness of heros to sacrifice themselves for those ideals . Whedon weaves these threads throughout his story , and then trusts his audience to be able to enjoy the action and the deeper significance at the same time . Truly , a rare cinematic treat .
12325|5|awesome performance by theron .
12328|5|This movie is about as good as they get . Very important for people to watch . Prejiduce is as alive today as it has ever been folks .
12329|5|One hell of a movie .
 1233|5|Samuel Jackson is the best thing that happend to this movie . This movie doesn't get boring , the action and comedy are superb , John Travolta is very good himself .
12331|5|once again i find myself defending a movie to all my friends which i loved and they didn't . my only problem with the movie is that the title and cover imply an action-type movie , when the film was really more of a thinker . other than that , i thought it was superbly written and directed . it's hard to follow all the differnet sub-plots , but that's the beauty of it ; the subtlties that tie all of the stories together . i really like the fact that it's not skewed toward a specific race . it shows the very present condition of all races judging all other races with their own preconcieved prejudices , even sometimes subconciously . but at the same time , even the seemingly most racist character in the movie ( Matt Dillan ) has somewhat of a defendable position , due to the situation of his father-- as do the other characters due to their life situations . a brilliant film from all sides .
12332|5|Wow . In the tradition of Latin American or Guy Ritchie cinema . . . this movie is one of those films that brings it all together neatly but up until it does you are left waiting breathlessly . Great performances by all , esp . Cheadle , Bullock , Newton and Howard . A real plus to see Bullock be VERY unlikeable . A wonderful film to watch more than once .
12336|5|This movie is really good . It isn't the same old story we've all seen a million times . . . its very original . It just came out on DVD recently and I recommend that you at least rent it . If you have ever read " Brave New World " ( which everyone should its a great book ) you will appreciate the similarities .
12337|5|One of the most underrated movies of the year . Could have been a little smarter in certain parts , but A LOT of fun .
 1234|5|A brilliantly told nasty story . Every role is well played , the script is crisp and clever , and the direction is first rate .
12340|5|Clever , artistic and real talent combine to make a proper family movie . No super-heroes saving the Universe here , just down-to-earth creativity and humourous to boot !
12341|5|Wallace and Gromit are , without a doubt , the two most charming , lovable , heart-warming and sweet-natured characters to ever grace both television and the silver screen . " The Curse of the Were-Rabbit " is outrageously funny and quite simply , hilarious without being insulting . Nick Park is a genius ; this movie is a labor of love and the best one I have ever seen . W & G are not just for kids . Some of the adults who are head over heels in love with this dynamic duo are the most worldly , sophisticated , accomplished and even cynical people I know . Wallace's big , goofy grin and Gromit's deep , soul eyes have captured hearts from all age groups and all walks of life . I'd give it six stars it they were available ! : )
12342|5|This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen . Being an avid rabbit lover and owner it reminded me of my bunnies so much . Its just overall cute and funny . I loved it so much I saw it twice just to take in all the things I may have missed . I just can't belive that clay-mation could be so precise and entertaining . Bravo to the makers of this funny and amazing movie . And it isn't just for kids , alot of adult humor in it also .
12343|5|Just like the videos I own . Funny and cute .
12346|5|Seldom do I get so much pure viewing pleasure from a film in the cinema as I did while watching 'The Curse of the Were-Rabbit' . For those of you unfamiliar with Wallace and Gromit , they are the loveable clay motion creations of Nick Park : Wallace , a slightly gormless , unfailingly polite bachelor inventor , and his long-suffering intellectual canine partner , Gromit . Their relationship is like that of an old married couple , and the adventures in which they get entangled are utterly incongruous with their domestic natures . In this film , they are running a humane pest control service and find themselves dealing with a beast , an enormous mutant were-rabbit , who is endangering the prize vegetables grown by the local villagers to exhibit at the annual fair . The film is unapologetically silly and deviously clever , paying homage to King Kong , Jaws , and a whole rake of early horror flicks , revelling in the hackneyed characters that populate such films - the superstitious village yokels , the semi-crazed preacher , etc . It would have been easy for the filmmaker to drop in these references in a heavy-handed fashion , sticking out as anomalies from the flow of the story , as was the case in places with Shrek , but Park's touch is so deft and natural that they add entertainment value for adults and children alike , albeit for different reasons . There is also a love interest , although , don't expect to have your emotions wrenched . Other than that , I am giving nothing away , as there is a twist in the tale which you may not see coming . Just watch it .
12349|5|This movie was the best ! Everything was so interesting ! I just couldn't look away .
 1235|5|This movie has become the basis of comparison for all movies I've seen since . Absolutely king in all areas it tries at : style , dark humor , original filmmaking , dialogue , and action . A + +
12357|5|This movie paints an incredible picture of a gambling addict . John Anthony ( McCoughnahay ) is a stellar ex-college athlete who's career was ended by an injury . The guy sits around an office and is more or less miserable when he catches a big break due to his knack for sports gambling , and he goes from basically a farmboy to a NYC hot-shot overnight . He rises and falls quickly but he's not the guy with the problem - that's Walter ( Pacino ) . He lives not for the thrill of victory but for the defeat . He explains that gambling addicts are not actually addicted to winning - it's losing that they crave . It's that moment when you know you've got it all on the line , everything you own is riding on one bet . . . nothing can match that high . Renee Russo is excellent in her supporting role as Walter's wife who refuses to give up on him .
12358|5|This was an excellent French film by the woman who starred in Amelie . Has some French regulars . Very engaging film taking place during World War I , about a polio infected woman searching for her lost lover who is missing in action as the war comes to an end . Very complex plot that unfolds beautifully . Jodie Foster plays a part in it , which eliminated the film from contention for best foreign film category at the Academy awards .
12361|5|A fantastic movie and the best in the series so far , with a great combination of action , fantasy horror , adventure and teen romance to make an awesome blockbuster . Be warned that this is quite a scary movie and little kids might get scared .
12368|5|Definetely the best of the 4 movies . Had a better and more mature story line to it , just like the book , and for the most part , stayed close to the book . The characters were better played , and the new characters ie : Cedric , Fleur , Krum , Cho , etc . were amazing . Great special effects in the challenges , especially the dragon scene , and very emotional and scary .
 1237|5|An instant classic as soon as it came out . Like Resevoir Dogs a must see brutally honest and violent vision by QT . Inspired performances by all .
12371|5|a wonderful allegory to the story of Christianity . the parallels were unbelievable . watching Aslon climb the mountain bore a striking resemblace to Jesus in the garden . even if you're not looking for ties to Christianity , it was still a great film that I would recommend to anyone , and the battle scenes were non-gory enough for the whole family .
12372|5|I thought the movie had that edgey feel of actually being there . The movie was very close to the book and it was an amazing theme . The acting could use a touch up but other than that it was a wonderful movie that I hope to show my children if I have any . The graphics were also very amazing .
12379|5|Top notch movie making here . You can bring anyone from 3 to 83 and they will be entertained here !
12381|5|There is no doubt that this will be a classic . " The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe " is a solid representation of C . S . Lewis's world ; there are few tweaks in the storyline ( the beginning of the story , mostly , but the more realistic approach is appreciated in the real world portion of the movie ) , but it is mostly quite faithful to the novel . SYNOPSIS : . . . I wont get into it , you probably have already read it . PROS : Only with this level of computer technology could we get such a rich and fluid world that does the imagination justice ( and for those critics who are sticking their nose up in the air and saying that " well , my imagination was far better " , I'd wager to say that if we put your glorious imagined version on screen , most people would highly disagree ; in short , " stow it " ) . As mentioned before , there was little done to stray from the novel ( there are three or four notable exceptions , but they do not detract from the movie ) . The children did an admirable job portraying Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy . Georgie Henley ( Lucy ) was particularly impressive , and I think shed give Dakota Fanning a run for her money . The non-human characters were well rendered . The great battle , though somewhat brief , was great . The soundtrack was beautiful . The two hour and twelve minute running time passes as quickly as does the time in the real world compared to that in Narnia . CONS : They could have certainly done more with Aslan ; it was easy for me to forgive , though , since most people would be bringing their children to see this , and kids in the theater had a difficult time sitting through two hours as it was . I hope that , once released on DVD , it might involve Aslan more . Only once did I feel that the CG failed . And Im still trying to figure out why that cat in the end ( during the coronation scene ) had a mustache and eyeglasses clearly drawn on him , like some prankster went in with the Microsoft Paint program and hand-drawn eyeglasses and the mustache . Maybe it was some bizarre inside joke , but it totally distracted me from the movie . OVERALL : Definitely worth seeing , definitely worth buying on DVD .
12383|5|AMAZING ! ( Especially if you read the book first ) . What a great family film for everyone to enjoy !
12384|5|hella tight , but too short
12387|5|Brilliant movie . Very funny and fab animations . I love the lemurs- I like to move it move it ! The penguins are funny as well . definately 5 star !
12388|5|I deffinately loved this movie . . . I like to move it move it . . hahaha . . . . This is a family friendly movie , and I reccomend it to all ages . . . xD
 1239|5|This movie was so unique and fascinating . However , it was a case of you either loved it or hated it . The narrative storyline is so interesting and the characters are uniquely quirky . The dialogue sticks out as one of the most innovative things about the film . Just a great creative vision and well worth several watchings .
12392|5|Very cute . Very funny . Very well done . A lot of adult jokes , that no child would get , but would laugh at anyway . The penguins were awesome , and so was Melmin ( the giraffe )
12394|5|5-star excellence , yet niche appeal only . Capote is a brilliant examination of the human psyche , in particular , Capote's , with themes of societal marginalization , narcissim , empathy , and the intersection / overlap of the same . This movie chronicles Capote's writing of a book about a Kansas quadruple murder , 'In Cold Blood , ' a torturous yet sublime project that required years of emotional dedication during which Capote , something of an outsider himself , drew close to one of the 2 sociopaths and thru that relationship elicited the facts for the book . 'Capote' is not entertaining--there's no suspension of disbelief , escapist action or comedy , intellectual diversion of a whodunit , nor drama with a happy ending . But it is a display of crisp filmmaking--no extaneous story , no unnecessary dialogue , nor extra emotion , but quality writing and acting , for which lead actor Philip Seymour Hoffman rightly earned his Golden Globe . Consequently , this movie will appeal to those who admire movie crafts . Americana aficionados and writers , especially of the true crime genre , might also have special interest . And those who'd most appreciate 'Capote' might be those involved by profession or circumstance in getting info from sociopaths during years of drawn- out , emotionally toilsome legal process--such might find I-am-not-alone comfort in the movie .
12396|5|What Philip Seymour Hoffman does in the title role is less acting than it is an act of necromancy . I am always in reverent awe when I witness truly great acting , and that's what you'll see here . Hoffman is nothing less than stupendous as Truman Capote . He brings the character back to life in the same way that Jack Nicholson did with " Hoffa " and George C . Scott did with " Patton . " Where the 1967 film " In Cold Blood " focused on the 2 killers , the murders they committed , their trial , and eventual execution , " Capote " focuses instead on the monumentally-talented , monumentally-egotistical and tortured man who immortalized them in his classic " non-fiction novel . " The film covers the period from when Capote first read of the Clutter murders in the NY Times in November 1959 until the executions of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock in April 1965 in Kansas . The supporting cast is uniformly excellent . Particularly noteworthy are Clifton Collins Jr . as Perry Smith , Catherine Keener as Harper Lee , and Chris Cooper as Detective Alvin Dewey . It's very rare that I'm so enthusiastic about a contemporary movie , so take my heartfelt advice , and run , don't walk , to see it . You probably won't be able to catch the film at your local multiplex mall theatre ( which will probably be playing " Harry Potter " in 2 theatres and the latest Adam Sandler-Tara Reid movie ) , but if you do revere great acting as I like to think I do , this is one you won't want to miss . Trust me . It'll be worth the effort of searching it out .
 1240|5|Totally awesome movie , its a timeless classic everyone should see .
 1241|5|Despite the fact that my top 10 of all time includes movies from the 30's , 40's , and 50's , this ranks # 1 . Amazing acting , characters , story , and dialogue .
12412|5|The funniest of the rash of Owen Wilson / Vince Vaughn moves that have come out in recent years . I highly recommend it .
12413|5|Well , I caught the 4 : 00 pm showing of this movie at the theater , and returned for the 9 : 30 pm showing tonight . While the movie got off to a slow start , and during the first 15 minutes was left to wonder what exactly the hype was all about , when the movie actually got started and my question was answered . It's friggin' hillarious . Vince Vaughn is a hero of mine ( I'll forgive him the misfortune that was Be Cool ) and this movie made him even more so in my eyes . His facial expressions were nothing short of priceless , and he delivers his lines with such vigor that it looks as though this is the most fun he's had on a set in a long time . Owen Wilson was wonderful as well , playing his typical player-but-nice-guy-at-the-same-time role which was perfect for the movie . It is rude , unappologetic , and had both the audiences I was in today in an uproar of laughter . This movie will be promptly added to my movie collection once out on DVD . It's Wedding Season !
12414|5|I was lucky enough to view an advanced screening of Wedding Crashers last Thursday night . Hilarious doesn't do the film justice . You know how in most films you remember the funniest parts and bring them up as you leave the theater ? This one , it's hard to remember the best parts because there's so many of them . Unlike his previous films , where Vince Vaughn is usually reduced to the role of 'scene stealer' , here we get a full dose of Babaganush , and he's in his finest form since 'Swingers' . If you liked him in his Swingers / Made persona , you'll love him here . Some of the riffs that he has literally will have you holding your sides with laughter . Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson . You either like him or you don't . He's more of the straight man in this film , although he does have some pretty good lines too , and he has great chemistry with Vaughn , especially in the scenes where they're fighting . He's the ying to Vaughn's yang . The movie certainly 'earns' it's R rating . There's a healthy dose of nudity , sex related hijinks , and f-bombs . But it's not 'gross out' humor a la American Pie . It pushes boundaries , but not just in a 'shock value' way . It's genuinely funny . I saw the movie with a bunch of critics , who usually the jaded type , were laughing their asses of as well . Guys will love this movie and will be quoting it for the rest of the year . Girls will love it too though , and there is a romantic subplot ( cheesy at times , but forgivable given how funny the movie is ) , with Rachael McAdams doing a great job as Owen Wilson's love interest . Isla Fischer plays the role of 'scene stealer' in this one , serving as Vince Vaughn's psycho love interest . And Chris Walken is Chris Walken . So overall . . inappropriate , hilarious and glorious . Better than Oldschool . Way better than Anchorman . Best comedy of the year , maybe the last couple of years .
12418|5|Excellent ; thoughtful , informative , interesting
12419|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end . Granted , I'm fascinated by the history of the time period portrayed and the politics involved . If you're not interested in those things you may not get much from the movie . . . but you should . See it anyway & try to understand what it's all about . What it's about is as current today as it was way back when . Funny ( or not ) how history repeats . A film of this type , with this message will always be relavent , no matter which side of the political spectrum you prefer . I thought the movie was brilliantly filmed in black & white . I enjoyed the editing and camera angles . The dialougue is intelligent and , at times , quite funny in a low-key sort of way . There's more going on than meets the eye . Finally , the movie made me want to find out even more about the characters involved . If a film can make me pick up a book then it has done it's job .
12420|5|This movie was awesome . The story was so interesting because of the historical aspects and the acting was really good . . . plus it had a lot of humor . It was clever and intense , and I'd watch it again in a heartbeat .
12425|5|A truly excellent movie from Disney . Mixing slick direction , great acting , an excellent and fascinating plot with great humor , this movie is a success from beginning to end . The plot and the progression of that plot is quite interesting and includes several great twists . Nicolas Cage leads an excellent cast which also includes Christoper Plummer and Jon Voight . I also love the pro-democracy vibe such as when Nicolas Cage looks in awe at a particular line that basically boils down to whoever has the power to do what is right has the responsibility to DO what is right . That's so true ! Also , the ending is definately MY kind of ending !
12426|5|A great family movie with an excelent twist , how do you find a treasure when you first have to find a map ? My dad even got into this one on account of it made mention of his group the Masons ( I think I can mention that he is one since they don't seem to be quite as secretive as they once were ) , and he does not watch too many Disney movies anymore . The film contained so much obviously well researched historical information and was so well acted that I actually started wondering if the treasure was real .
12428|5|I loved National Treasure ! I went to see it with my dad for my last brithday , and we both laughed through it . It's very well done , and actually has an interesting story line . Nicholas Cage did a great job , as did the other actors , and actresses , and I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who wants an adventure .
 1243|5|Possibly the best movie I have ever seen . . .
12435|5|I really enjoyed this movie ! A great amount of action , fun for the whole family ! 4 . 5 or so might be a better rating , but overall it was very entertaining . I'm not a big fan of Nicolas Cage , but it's easy to forget about him watching this movie . Engrossing , and Riley was hilarious .
12436|5|AWESOME MOVIE . . . really interesting
12438|5|A very fun movie . It had excitment and humor bond very well . While I don't care much for Nicoles Cage I still really like his performance and his friend was hillarious . Worth Watching .
 1244|5|yaaaaay . pure entertainment
12441|5|THis is super good ! Nicholas Cage preforms at his best . Suspense , humor , romance , everything in one movie . I completley I forgot i was in a theatre b / c I never got bored and moved my eyes from the screen ! People ages 6-60 were in the theatre !
12443|5|Great movie , but I wanted more of the family / personal life .
12445|5|Excellent flick . Not perfect , but Osacar nominations are a certainty .
12446|5|A labour of love for Kevin Spacey . The film hops between the genres of bio-pic and musical , with flashbacks into the subconscious of the main character in a way that is a little scattered . But I don't think it harms the telling of a good story or the examination of the character of the driven and charismatic Bobby Darin . And Kevin Spacey looks like he is having a pure ball when he's singing Darin's songs .
12449|5|In gruesome perfection , 'Hostel' gives a taste of hell , an exhibition of depravity so deep that man actually pays to sin in the most desperately wicked ways , and Satan laughs at making man his " b * tch . " Three guys go into a hostel . . . likeable enough , only flirting with sin really , on a trip , just trying to be happy . But one by one they end up victims of a pay-to-torture sadism club , $ 25 , 000 for an American . Near flawless story , characters , acting , directing , set , music , production . Even an empathetic protagonist and a denouement , but if your resolution must be happy happy , save your $ . 'Hostel' fleshes out and inspires responses to evil--despair , energization , or numbness . This movie is filled with nudity , drugs , and extreme gore , but it's not glorified , and so I recommend 'Hostel' for exposing man's sinsickness and hope that viewers might seek the Cure . ( Last week's news here in Florida showed how this sadistic tendency is more and more out now , not restricted to government torture or internet sites : one man was arrested for double murder after spending money for bus , taxi , and hotel to go manhunting in a park just because he said he felt like killing , and another 2 guys were arrested for murder after videotaped beating homeless men smiling through it all . )
12459|5|Concur with Seraph . This is one of the better suspense movies I've seen in a while . I'll cite a few reasons why I liked this movie : 1 ) A very good plot . It's got all that New Orleans' Hoodoo / Voodoo interacial gobbledygook which is always good for a scare ( Much more effective than the Lamo " Haunted Mansion " Disney offering ) . They do a great job in tricking the viewer into thinking who the " whodunit " is ; but no one suspects what really transpires in the very creative ending . 2 ) Great locales . Pre-Katrina New Orleans and neighboring Terrebonne Parish are depicted . Even before the hurricanes hit , you get the idea that this is a part of the country where you are better off having gills and an umbrella strapped to your head . I recall on a Charleston SC Ghost Walk , the tour guide commenting Charleston ranks a distant second to New Orleans in ghost sightings . One look at this movie and I'm reminded of Dan Aykroyd's comment , " We're in Ghost Central Station . " It is one of the more effective uses of location to create a haunting mood since Philadelphia and " The Sixth Sense . " 3 ) Kate Hudson is hot and a pretty good actress to boot ( y ) . You'll get to see her in a few panty-clad scenes , tight-jeans scenes , and a Damsel-in-Distress scene .
12476|5|I adored the movie , I went and saw it with my friend Beth in theatre and to be 100 % honest , I liked it a lot better then I liked the original . Johnny Depp plays the best Willy Wonka !
 1248|5|I saw this for the first time at a midnight showing and I loved it so much ! This movie is one of the all-time greatest movies !
12482|5|Much better than I expected . Excellent ! The story , casting , and cinemaphotography were all great . This will definitely go down in history as one of John Singleton's greatest movies .
12483|5|Macho with a soft side , whodunit with a quality story , pathos and some good action scenes , though it's not action the whole way through . Sweet goodytwoshoes lady in Detroit took in numerous foster children through the years but actually adopted four of them that were in unique ways unadoptable / degenerates . Anyway , years later she is shot , prompting her four now adult sons to reunite and seek out the truth about the shooting . Recognized most of the actors , though can't recall names , except Mark Wahlberg ( one of brothers ) and Terrance Howard ( one of cops on case ) . Motown soundtrack . I think most everyone would enjoy this never boring good-vs-evil redemption movie , though some bad language and a bit of violence and sexual explicitness .
12488|5|A good movie with a little play on history . Good cast , well written story and great effects . A fair and balanced telling of the story which appears to have gained the favor of some muslim groups . The movie shines a better light on Arabs then most movies have done . Well worth seeing on the big screen !
12490|5|Oh my goodness , I loved this movie . I was skeptical at first because film just doesn't have the same spark as a live Broadway show but this totally blew me away . Its beautiful to watch and Emmy Rossum , who plays Christine , is fantastic . She has a true talent .
  125|5|I found Silence of the Lambs to be one of the greatest horror films ever made because it works on two levels . First it is a brilliant psychological thriller and two it is a shocking bizzare and often time frightning horror film . Not to metion a breakthrough script , magnificent directing and ingenious performances from Jodie Foster and ( The Man ) Anthony Hopkin's as the now famed Hannibal Lector . This picture put the thriller suspence type movie goers in the same theater with Friday the Thirtenth fans . A breakthrough film through and through . HIGHL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! This is a thinking man's horror picture .
12506|5|A really funny , family movie . The kids are great actors and the story is great .
12507|5|I'm glad this movie was made . It's a slice of real life whether you like it or not . Homosexuality has been around since the beginning of time--it's not going away folks . Instead of constantly persecuting these people , maybe it's time to try and understand them . I think this movie is a small step in the right direction . I think all the " Brokebutt " comments are so juvenile and ignorant . People need to grow-up . Maybe it's time we focus on more pressing issues that are really affecting society . I really have a problem with my tax dollars being used to raise the children of people who are too stupid or lazy to practice birth control .
12508|5|The feel-good comedy of the Christmas season ! ! ! The Michelle Williams character to the Heath Ledger character : " I knew you two were up to something on your fishing trips when you didn't bring home any TROUT . . . . . " You said a mouthful , honey . But beware . . . lots of man-cuddle action . Kind of like Mid-night Mass for the Gay community , no jokes allowed . . . . ever so serious & we must be ever so reverent & not joke about like sounding titles of a humourous nature . . . . . boom-boom mountain , smelly tent mountain , nervous sheep mountain , KY mountain bloody stool mountain etc etc etc ad infinitum . . . . amen . We kid around because we love . Actually unlike any movie any of us have ever seen . . . . . . worth 9 bucks , I suppose .
 1251|5|Pulp Fiction is one of the most eclectic films ever made . That being said , it's one of the most well-blended films ever . The stories , and certainly odd ones at that , are told to us not in chronoligical order , but mixed together in a way to evoke terrific power and emotion . The dialogue is most definitely the BEST dialogue I've ever heard in a film . Although it employs more explatives than usually heard in movies in 1994 , they are used in the right places , adding the right feeling to the lines , unlike most modern films where the words are added to give them movie a R rating . The visiual style is excellent as well . Quite possibly , the best movie of 1994 , the best year for movies since 1939 .
12511|5|This is an awesome move . The movie was beautifully directed and skillfully acted . I am sorry to break it to all those who have not seen this movie and refuse to see it because of their homophobic fears but I foresee at least one oscar coming for the movie . The sexual seens and the kissing were a very small part of this movie . It was a story of true love and the results of what happens in life when men try to please society rather than their hearts . Ladies and Gent . . . . this is life ! !
12512|5|Update ; having seen this excellent film , the soul-love portrayed transcends the sexes of the people involved , and takes us on a human journey of love that , through fear of society's constraints ( not God's ) they are unable to naturally express . To conform , they get married and in the process hurt more people , yet not so much as they are hurting themselves . A film through which you will experience the depth of their love and understand that love is greater than the two protaganists . Superbly acted . Norainbows , if you didn't understand it , you've got a problem . Not only has this film won the top prizes at Cannes and Venice but the Film Critics and Reviewer's Top Award . It sounds a cracking good film and can't wait to see it . For those who think it's just a gay film . . well , above all , it's a love film and for those who think it's misrepresentative of cowboys , what do you think went on when guys were up in those mountains on their own ? Louie : King Kong ! My fears are confirmed that you have a lot of growing up to do , Louie .
12514|5|Great movie . Have you noticed that all of the negative ratings were by people who haven't even seen the movie ? It's amazing how homophobic closeted people are .
12517|5|Best movie of the year . The acting great , filming excellent , writing and directing beyond belief . Finally something worth spending money to go see and not a remake of a big ape running through New York or a family who never heard of birth control . TRULY OUTSTANDING !
12518|5|With a small amount of trepidation , I walked into the theatre with my spouse to see this film yesterday evening . Once I got past the gratuitous / obligatory homophobic case of the heebie jeebies , I settled in and realized why this picture is being nominated for awards left and right . It is an excellent movie . And homosexuality is not even particularly " central " to the theme . Brokeback Mountain is a love story . And it's a sad one . I noted above that the " gay " component of this film is not central to it because lots of love stories are sad . Romances between people fail to flourish or " succeed " for any host of reasons . This is not a human experience limited to queers . The doomed nature of this relationship is as much a result of the choices the protagonists make as it is of the unwillingness of many in larger society to accept gay couples and relationships . The performances by both lead actors , particularly Ledger , were sensitive and not over the top . Ledger's character was truly the most haunted / conflicted by the relationship the pair develops as young men . The price of the tickets to Brokeback Mountain were a good investment and I'm glad I saw the movie . I left the theatre feeling rather sad for the fates of both characters and the story I saw has had me thinking all day .
 1252|5|Pulp Fiction is dizzying , dazzling piece of film-making with excellent dialogue , acting , directing , and overall a real thrill . I could watch it over and over again . Quentin Tarantino bet his debut by far . If you haven't seen this , you're missing out . Summary : ONE OF THE GREAT FILMS OF THE 90s
12522|5|MUNICH is a triumph . ( JAWS : fish bites boat . . . . . . . . . . ET : a fuggly alien can be cuddly . . . . . . . SAVING PRIVATE RYAN : WWII was about dumb-dumb Matt Damon ? ) This movie is Speilberg's redemption song . Eric Bana is a knight on a quest to vanquish evil , but as we know , like the poor , our lord said evil will always be with us . . . our best friend our intimate enemy . The violence and the shock value puts other hacks to shame . . . . . . . . ( Scott / Scorcese / Attenborough / Coppolla / Peckinpah / Tarantino etc ) These lessons of Munich will be learned & re-learned , off screen & off -----God help us .
12527|5|Very , very solid movie . Jack Black was surprisingly good in this one . The special effects are mind blowing . Peter Jackson hits one over the fence again ! My one question would be , " What is with the sleeveless dress , in December , in New york city at the top of the Empire State Building ? " The girl is unphased and can climb ladders in that kind of weather ?
 1253|5|Anyone who says this movie is bad was ether not paying attention or couldn't look past the violence . this movie was very smart and phycological . it was full of all worlds : comedy , drama , suspense , irony and crime . but the real thing that made this movie good was the character building , all of the ( what ignorant people call pointless ) conversations between the main characters build a sort of warm , smart , and different type of gangster in which we have never seen before and this is what makes Terintino the mastermind of a genius . If you can look past the violence , this movie is full of halarious irony and incredible acting . my favorite of all time and one of the best !
12533|5|Good movie , funny , yet clean , Will Ferrell is great . He is probably one of the best up and coming actors right now .
12539|5|A History of Violence is an examination of the grip and depth of human violence . The portrayal of violence is not artistic like Natural Born Killers , nor deglorified overchoreographed thrill like scenes from Mr . instead , it is raw , realistic , graphic and necessary . If sex , nudity and violence are either temptations or offenses to you , don't see this movie . Performances and screenplay A + , the technical part not as good , especially the nudity and sex scenes , which were few , necessary in concept , but mechanical in portrayal . ( I felt as if someone was saying , " freeze , need to capture this pubic hair , " or " shift , need another butt shot . " ) This movie has no tidy wrap-up ending , is not an upper nor a downer , just reality . It biblically portrays both the miserable condition / need of man and man's sublime possibilities , and exposes the futility of man's contrivances for escaping / avoiding evil ( pain , chaos , unhappiness ) while subtly pointing to the only true Way of deliverance .
12552|5|I know Jarheads , 'cause I are one . You could only get a more accurate picture of what the Corps is by picking my brain for a couple days or going to boot camp yourself !
12553|5|Great inside look at a soldier's life and dramatic view of what many endure . I felt like this was a honest look into daily life and not some glorified movie of war . This is was 'real' .
12567|5|Holocaust movie , but it takes place in present day ( not too many flashbacks either , and those are hazy ) : " Never forget . " That's the whole movie , but I haven't ruined it for you , since the impact is in the delivery . Glorious Van Gogh colors , quirky touches of humor , then hinting entry of unease , and " whomp ! " a blow to the chest leaving me dumbfounded , frozen , eyes welled-up--when I got to my car I cried and couldn't stop . Wows , huhs , a psychological trip I couldn't forget if I tried . Stars Elijah Wood as Jonathan , " the collector , " an American Jew who ponders a photo of late grandfather w / mysterious woman from WWII Ukraine and sets on a journey to find her . Hooks up w / makeshift family buisness " Heritage Tours " that guides rich Jews thru Ukraine in search of personal history . Cranky old grandfather Alex drives ( tho he claims he's blind ) , Americaphile grandson Alex translates , and Sammy Davis Jr , Jr ( " seeing eye bitch " ) rides along . ( historical background , not from movie : after Nazi invasion of Soviet Union , mass killings of Jews were done by mobile units , even by auxiliary police and pogroms conducted by locals . . . Ukraine , place of movie , was one such place )
12568|5|Just goes to show you what an upstart group of misfits can do to a ell trained professional team if they put their heads together . . . LIKE I SAID . IFC Films have redeemed themselves from last years Farenheit 911 ACLU Debacle . . .
12578|5|This is probably one of my favorite Christmas movies now just because of all of the hilarity . The tanning scene is so priceless !
12584|5|The best movie I've seen all year . After losing my Mom last year and these being the first holidays without her , this movie made me laugh . It's an A + in my book . Bah Hum Bug to those that don't like it .
 1259|5|Awesome movie , but NOT for the chronologically challenged ! ! ! Pulp Fiction is right up there with Once Upon a Time in America .
 1261|5|Besides the fact that Pulp Fiction had all the elements of a great movie done by an brilliant writer / director , it served also a gateway to a lot of people . It proved to so many that a film doesn't require a lot of money to be truly a piece of cinematic art and indie films were finally getting the attention they deserved . It inspired a host of Tarantino imitators to create colorful , violent crime films from the sublime ( The Usual Suspects ) to the mere forgettable ( Truth or Consequences , NM ) . But what is so amazing about this film ( and hasn't even been touched on in this slew of reviews ) is that with Tarantino , nothing is sacred and everything is fair game ! Accidental murder results in name calling and a hilarious aftermath , sodomy / rape results in a comical bit where Butch can't make up his mind which weapon to save his enemy with , racial slurs are used repeatedly by a white guy who , consequently , is married to an African American woman , and Jules ( who breaks a major commandment for a living ) recites word for word a quote from the Holy Bible . This film has shined a light on the most taboo of subjects and made us not only stare in wonder , but made us take notice of the one film that mirriors society's own irreverence !
12615|5|I thought this movie was excellent . I had the pleasure of seeing it with some people who hadn't seen previews so they had no idea what was going on . . . but of course those of us who did see the previews pretty much had it ruined for us . But nonetheless its still a great movie with a lot of action and of course , the lame one liners . . . but you can't have an action without lame one liners right ?
 1262|5|Excellent Movie ! Brilliant acting by Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta . A typical Tarintino film - if you liked his other films , you'll love this . Jules ( Jackson ) and Vincent ( Travolta ) are basically two hitmen . But they seem to consider their jobs as quite ordinary ( as their witty conversations on their way to kill people would suggest ) . Now , they have to kill a boxer , Butch ( Bruce Willis ) for doing something he shouldn't have to their boss - Marcellus Wallace . There are interesting things that happen along the way . Vincent takes out Marcllus' wife Mia ( Uma Thurman ) , Vincent accidently shoots someone , Jules and Vincent get caught in a robbery and Jules thinks that God rescued him and Vincent from bullets shot at them . . . . . just to name a few ! ! ! !
 1264|5|Quentin Tarantino is an extremely talented director . The time sequence in this movie is especially interesting . Great acting by all in this film
12644|5|i liked it better than house of 1000 corpses
 1265|5|Tarantino's masterpiece is brilliantly put together . The sheer brilliance of breaking up the story in such a way is completely invonceivable . Samual Jackson gives a great performance and compliments a good cast . This is the original real real ignore the imitators .
 1266|5|My all time favorite movie . Hard core modern day mafia by genius director , Quentin Tarantino . How can you go wrong with a cast like that ? Complex story lines are key .
12685|5|Just like the movie exclaims , " Unraveling the truth about Michael Moore's Fahreheit 9-11 . " In this documentary you will hear from many people including those who never even knew they were in the Mike's movie !
12686|5|The truth is a breath of fresh air , in a liberal lies ifested environment . Great docomentary ! ! !
12689|5|The best of Moore's feature films . A very dismaying and heartbreaking expose of the remorseless and uncaring nature of corporate decision making , and the failure of those supposedly in charge in the auto industry to protect their companies , their workers and the towns they operated in for the sake of the bottomline . Just shows you that it doesn't take much in the way of brains to make money , and that short-sightedness and greed in the so-called minds of our corporate leadership usually results in killing the goose that lays the golden eggs . What was truly reprehensible in this film was the absolute arrogance and self-centered attitudes of the putative leaders of town and industry . These money-grubbing scumbags should have bones rammed up their collective butts so the dogs can drag them through the streets .
 1269|5|Yet another great movie for the John Travolta fan . With cameos by Bruce Willis and a host of other actors , Pulp Fiction uses destruction , swearing , and death to portray a remarkably entertaining movie . Samuel L . Jackson also provides a strong character and delivers lines that everyone will and has been saying . Not for the weak at heart !
12690|5|Moore is great ! He's less a great filmmaker than he is someone who exposes things for what they are . He may be America's most valuable citizen because he cares enough to make his case . And in a culture that has a 48-hour memory span , he documents our world for all time .
12692|5|" Trekkies " is a rather endearing portrait of Star Trek fandom . Pretty much as you'd expect , this means lots of interviews with omnipresently costumed obsessives whose living rooms perfectly resemble the bridge of the Enterprise . However , the most entertaining reflections on the Trek fandom come from the experiences of the Star Trek actors themselves . Brent Spiner and Denise Crosby comment on spookily realistic naked portraits of themselves sent by fans , John De Lancie recounts people confronting him on the street to ask if he can really resurrect the dead and Nichelle Nichols talks of how a young girl once saw her on television at a time when black actresses in important roles were virtually non-existent , and was inspired to pursue an acting career herself . That girl's name was Whoopi Goldberg . It's feel-good stories like this that make the film so pleasant . Star Trek , whilst being merely a popular television franchise , has always espoused fundamentally good moral messages like sexual and racial equality , acceptance of diversity and the ideal of working for the purpose of fulfillment rather than simple monetary gain . Though often satirical , the film basically presents the idea that Trekkies have absorbed from Star Trek , amongst an advanced knowledge of Klingon linguistics and a penchant for wearing pointy ears , some pretty good axioms to live by .
12698|5|I love the commentary . I like how he suggests that US government is responsible for promoting violence as a means to solve problems rather than Marilyn Manson . I like how he uses Canada . Much better than Farnhiet 9-11 . No matter how many guns go off in Toronto , it will never be Detroit .
  127|5|What confuses me is why this is in the action section when it should be in the horror section ? Strange . Anyways , this has got to be one of the best horror tales ever made for the screen ! Foster Hopkins are excellent as is Demme's direction . The atmosphere is good , the tension is unbearable and all of it's praise is well-deserved . Excellent movie !
 1270|5|A Quentin Tarartino classic turned cult film , which has it all . Pulp Fiction , starring Samuel L . Jackson and John Travolta , features some extremely good acting and directing . Pulp Fiction is a movie that is destined to be a classic , so full of action suspense that you can't only see it once .
12701|5|it hits the mark , it is right about everything , America wake up ! !
12703|5|I think those kids in CO needed to get laid . That would have given them something to live for and love for . It is a shame - I feel sorry for anyone who could do that . Hmmm . . . the KKK was banned in 1871 , the NRA was formed in 1871 , very interesting . patriotism is the virtue of the viscous .
12708|5|What a great documentary ! ! ! This film is insightful , provocative , funny , and profound all at the same time . I love how Moore makes the connection between guns and fear in the US and this fear is based on history , lack of a social safety net , and propaganda that fans the flames . I respect him for having the courage to come out and say the things that need to be said and the genius to do it in a way that combines investigative reporting , political activism , and prankster trickery .
12709|5|Moore is great ! He's less a great filmmaker than he is someone who exposes things for what they are . He may be America's most valuable citizen because he cares enough to make his case . And in a culture that has a 48-hour memory span , he documents our world for all time .
12710|5|I thought this movie was funny . He actually had 3 teams of fact checkers and 2 teams of lawyors go through the whole movie to assert everything was fact . I do however agree with he uses his biased opinion to present his information . But that's what biased film makers do . I don't agree with everything he says , but we need someone like this to oppose the common belief and to open minds in our society . And hey , it won an Oscar , it can't have been that bad . I thought the film was very entertaining . No it's not about guns ultimately , it's about the US being a culture of fear , and guess what guys . I'm from Australia and I've lived in the US for 3 years now . It is a culture of fear . He was right .
12721|5|To be honest , the facts that were raised does not surprise me at all considering some of the comments I have read about gun control on this very website . . . . . I thought the film was very well presented and definately thought provoking . To BIGBABY , yes Michael Moore is making money out of things like this , but the fact that he is bringing attention to subjects like this should mean that your government should sort it out and pump money where its needed . Why should Michael Moore ? He didn't create this awful situation .
12724|5|It may be shocking at times , but I believe it is people like Michael Moore who keep America thinking . We NEED extreme , shamelessly curious people like Mr . Moore to balance the mega-conservative right-wing in this country . How WONDERFUL it was to see crusaders like Charleton Heston SQUIRMING with discomfort at Moore's in-your-face , can't-get-away questioning . QUESTIONS . That's what's so important about this movie . It makes us THINK . It confronts us with subjects we may often deny thinking about . Moore shows the danger of not examining even the most unpleasant aspects of our American society .
12729|5|Loved the movie , it's exactly what we need right now : introspection . Looking at our own society and talking about ways that we can fix them . More importantly , we need to look at how our actions in the past has contributed to our current problems internationally .
 1273|5|This is the movie that opened my eyes to alternative cinema . I saw this when I was in seventh grade and it blew my mind . I had never seen anything so original , so funny , so dark , so incredible in my entire life at that point . This movie opened the door to original ideas in the movie making industry . This film is one of the best independent films of our time and deserves to be recognized for the brilliant masterpeice of modern film making that it is . Superior cast . My favorite Bruce Willis character ever because it breaks his usual mold of John McClain action flicks . Highly recommended absoloutly mesmerizing . A masterpeice .
12732|5|Interesting that the movie is listed under the comedy category . Moore brilliantly utilizes a constant change of tone and emotion to keep the viewer's attention throughout the entire movie . There is not a down-point in this cinematic masterpiece . It departs from the status quo of hit movies today , acting as an expos of America's culture of fear . Moore directed a thought-provoking film , intellectually challenging the person watching to examine the very society in which they live . The documentary-style film travels around the country , interviewing people from the surprisingly articulate Marilyn Manson to Charlton Heston and two victims of the Columbine High School massacre . Capitalizing on the themes of his book Stupid White Men , Michael Moore explores the view of African Americans as criminals and menaces to society as well as the major theme of the danger of gun violence and why it occurs more frequently in America than any other civilized country . He uses resources such as actual footage of the Columbine shooting , facts about brash , reactionary measures taken by the U . S . throughout the world in the past half-century , and newscasts from local evening news stories to amplify the point he's trying to make . Whether you agree with him or not , this film is undeniably credible and keeps you entertained throughout ; it created in me at various points sentiments of anger , sadness , laughter , disbelief , and awe . That fact speaks volumes about its merits as an effective work .
12733|5|Perfect ! Dead on in terms of it's political statments . Really funny to watch at times , such as when Micheal Moore goes to Canada and tries to figure out why we're not shooting each other . Also very saddening and touching as well . I really wanted to punch Charleton Heston in the face by the end of the film !
12736|5|Great movie . Go see it .
12738|5|Wow--this documentary is well-researched and enlightening . Only the extreme right would hate it , because it violates what they believe : The rich corporations should get away with anything and everything , at the costs of the environment , animals , consumers , stock holders , and society as a whole . I will only drink soy milk or organic milk as a result of watching this . See this movie--and be prepared to get angry and demand changes . One of the most telling things about this movie is how it dissects modern corporate behavior and compares its attributes to that of a psychopath . Grim stuff---essential viewing !
12739|5|Worth seeing . The Enron story is an unbelievable story of greed - not just by the Skillings and Lays , but by their bankers , lawyers , accountants , customers , investors , and traders . There was so much cash being thrown off by the stock's meteoric rise , that everybody involved was content to take their place at the trough , and ignore their ethics . I was blown away by the price California paid for Enron's greed . Having lived through the rolling blackouts a couple of years ago , I had always found it extremely strange that the State would suddenly run out of power , especially in the winter . Well it turns out , a desperate Enron was driving its traders to convince power station operators to shut down , in order to drive the price of electricity up . Enron would profit from the increased prices , and more lucratively , gamble that the price of electricity would go up . These profits allowed Enron to maintain the facade of a financially healthy company . In California , businesses were being shut down , cars were crashing when streetlights went down , and the fifth largest economy in the world would be crippled for hours on end . And all so Enron could line their pockets . Governor Gray Davis plead to the Feds for help in regulating the price of energy . Unfortunately for California , George W . Bush is / was a close family friend of Lay , and even was recorded taping a birthday video for Skilling , and no help was forthcoming . ( to be fair , the Fed position was that this was a California issue , but the obvious conflict of interest made my stomach turn . ) Stunning sequences in this movie of Gray Davis questioning how half the states power plants could be down for maintenance at the same time , set against taped Enron trader calls to the power plants , saying that they need to find a reason to shut down for a little while . It's an ugly story , and tragic as well - the movie begins and ends with the suicide of one of Enron's beloved executives , not to mention the galling video clip of a laughing Skilling imploring his employees to put their entire 401K's in Enron stock . While the movie is a little heavy handed , it makes for compelling viewing .
12742|5|Whether you agree or disagree with Michael Moore , democracy needs people like him , who are not afraid to question the actions and intentions of the people whom we give the power to rule our country . George Bush is supposed to represent all Americans , Michael Moore included . If Moore were to keep his mouth shut , he would fail in his duty as an American citizen .
12750|5|Being propaganda doesn't make it false . Besides , people who were voting for Kerry were going to , movie or not . And republicans are very dense and stubborn - their vote is more about beating liberals than it is the betterment of the country . No facts or propaganda could change their mind . They don't care if Bush is a liar . So , who cares ? Good movie . ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) UPDATE . And they KNOW Bush is a liar . They don't care , people . It's like Ben Affleck's sister saying 'Gigli' was good . She knows it sucked , but she'll be damned if she is going to givwe critics the pleasure . Deep down they all know he is the worst president in history . They go to bed thinking about it . But if you say it to them , they will defend him at all cost . Come on , even republicans are not that stupid . They know . It's so obvious . ALL THE LIVING GREAT MINDS AGREE . I think it's a shame that folks voted for Bush , thus throwing our country away , basically , literally for spite . Damn shame . We will fall , just like Rome , and historians in the future will look upon this administration's run as the turning point . Naturally , republicans will dismiss this comment , like the stubborn morons they are . That's the problem - nobody will open their minds . THINK PEOPLE ! Trust me , THAT is what Jesus wants . ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) UPDATE Being against the war is the most support one can give the troops . If I was there , I would feel more supported by the people who wanted me to come home and NOT DIE . I would feel less supported by the people on the right , and the administration that said , casualties are irrelevant right now .
12752|5|great movie I love how the conservatives flood this one because they try so hard to dismiss whatever is popular , there are actually more informative documentaries but this one is great and is amazing , if you are basing your rating on how you feel politically rather than how it ranks as a documentary .
12763|5|You guys have to remember - Mike Moore is a filmmaker , an artist . Dubya is the President of the United States of America . Some of you think that Moore is distorting the public with this movie ? Its a movie ! Gee , I really think that Alien vs . Predator is really distorting people's view of the history of the planet ! Bullstuff ! Of course Dubya didn't go to war for political reasons - they are monetary reasons ! The Carlyle Group has $ 800 , 000 , 000 , 000 invested in the American War Machine . . . hmmm . Who's in the Carlyle Group ? the Suadi Binladen family , Texans + Bushes , Tony Blair . . . ? This is too much ! I was phyisically ill watching this movie ( not just from seeing Moore on screen , either ) but from the civilian causalties in Iraq . Oscar Wilde said , Patriotism is the virtue of the viscous . If you watched this movie and you were not touched deep down by the uncensored brutality of this war - then you are a true patriot !
 1277|5|This was one of the greatest movies ever in my opinion . With the quick action from robbery , gun shooting , great costumes , and it's all star cast , this movie had me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie .
12774|5|I don't have to watch a Michael Moore film or any major news network to confirm what I already think of George Bush . All I have to do is look at my own country and see that a convicted serial rapist ( Iorworth Hoare ) won 7million in a lottery win , students in serious debt , messed up travel and ask where my prime minister Tony Blair is to address these problems and realise hes too busy supporting a man who uses his power as an excuse to exploit and invade other countries that didn't pose a single threat to his in the first place . I don't have to ask myself if the war in Iraq was justified all I have to do is look at the death toll and the anger of many soldiers and their families who now question the mis-leading information they were given to invade a country . Whoever makes the choice not to see this film is obviously scared of certain facts that are being presented to them . Whilst I make it a habit to apologise for certain posts in the event of not offending anyone I won't be apologising for this one as its about time we faced reality that the incomptent and social inept who is now present in the oval office has single-handedly assisted himself in making not only fantastic viewing in a documentary that he starred in , but also some of the biggest blunders in political history .
12775|5|It's muckraking . . . but it's first-class funny as hell muckraking . I love watching my pansy-president sit in front of children for several minutes ( after he was told we were under attack ) doing nothing . Talk about deer in the headlights . Did he care that he might be a target thus the children just might be in danger ? Did he think to ask about his own family ? It's just too easy taking shots at this guy . The movie was funny- and certainly far-reaching at times .
 1278|5|All around great who-done-it type of movie . It was not your regular style of gangster movie . Great actors throughout the movie : Bruce , John , Uma and Samuel . You have to watch it more than once . It keeps you going .
12786|5|Michael Moores film Fahrenheit 9 / 11 gives his left leaning slant on the Bush Adminstration and 9 / 11 , just as Rush and OReilly and Hannity , etc . , give their right leaning slant on those topics every day on the radio and TV . I think Moores slant is closer to the truth . There is no doubt in my mind that Bush has screwed us up royally . I cannot remember a time in which there was so much animosity toward America around the globe . Do you know that the day after 9 / 11 there were candlelight vigils being held in Iran in sorrow and respect for our tragedy ? We had the whole world behind us , even after we went into Afghanistan , an action that most Americans , myself included , felt was justifiable and appropriate . The war in Iraq turned all of that good will into hatred . It has alienated former allies . It has divided our nation . It has taken the lives of hundreds of fine American servicemen and women . It has also ruined the lives of thousands of others who have been maimed , both physically and psychologically . It has also taken the lives of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians . The financial cost of the war is tremendous and will certainly have lasting implications for our economy . And what is the big reward for our efforts ? The removal from power of a murderous tyrant whom had already been so marginalized by the Gulf War that he posed no real threat to us or our allies . And the Iraqi people are so grateful for our intervention on their behalf that they are attempting to kill our soldiers every chance they get . Fahrenheit 9 / 11 put a spotlight on certain issues which have been rather puzzling to me , such as , why the delayed and seemingly half-hearted attempt at capturing Osama Bin Laden ? Why did we shift our focus from Al Qaeda , the extremist Muslim organization responsible for the 9 / 11 attack , to Iraq , a secular state with virtually no ties to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda ? Moores film might have you believe that the answer to those questions could be big money and power . I dont know that I ascribe to all of the conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships between the Bush Administration and the Saudis , or the role of large American corporations in the rebuilding of Iraq and its prized oil reserves , but I can tell you it all looks and smells very bad . If that sounds cynical , let me just remind you of the corrupting role that big money and power played in the recent implosion of our friends at Enron . In my opinion , this war has become a national tragedy for which the Bush Administration must be voted out of office . If Mr . Moores film helps accomplish this goal , than he is a hero in my estimation .
12789|5|I saw this movie over the weekend and I thought it was thought provoking but very disturbing at the same time . Im interested in finding out what Americans think about the film & Bush after they see it , because I don't understand why they ever liked him in the first place . The guys a loser , it's shows how he has always been a failure . He wouldn't have won the election , if he didnt cheat his way in . His previous work experience , consists of working for Oil companies ( go figure ) , which he proceded to run into the ground , if it weren't for his daddy ( His money , the money the saudi's have been giving his dad for years . . . um the account shared with the Bin Laden's ) , he'd be nobody . But this movie isn't just about Bush . There are alot of other topics presented . . . . The fact that nowadays , strangers and / or foreigners , are expendable as human beings . A phrase like Who cares , I dont know them after saying or doing something you would feel bad about doing to someone you knew / or cared about . Too many people couldn't care less about other people & find it hard to trust anyone . Too many people try to find the differences between people before realising that they have plenty of things in common . Or how being greedy for money & oil is more important than the lives of the solider's Bush sends overseas . The Bush families shared bank accounts with the Bin Laden family . . . . How on Sept . 11 , they flew 130 members of the Bin Laden family out of the states , while all other planes were grounded , instead of investigating / asking them any questions to see if they were involved . ( Any innocent persons would have welcomed the questions , if they knew it would help ) or how bout the young boys / girls ( early 20 yr olds ) that think it's cool that they can play their cd's in the tanks , while killing ( most of the time ) innocent people . How they were disapointed when they realised that going into the army , wasn't like a video game . I mean , any intelligent person , would find these comments scary . . . This is the way alot of Americans think . ( This is a problem ) ( Watch Micheal Moore's previous movie & tell me there isn't a problem with guns in America . . . Anyways ) These are human beings , real lives . . . . It's very disturbing to think that they don't see anything wrong when harming someone . Every human has a family , everyone has parents & siblings . Everyone has someone they love , and more people should take a walk in each other's shoes . I don't know any of you , but I sure as hell , wouldn't see you as my enemy . and another topic , Controlled bombing in Iraq . . . HAH , This movie shows that it's not controlled , you see babies that have been killed by the Americans bombs & rockets , reports of alot of American solider's who not only die , but come back with missing limbs ( who hears their stories on tv ? ) I could go on & on , But for anyone on here who makes a decision on the film , without seeing it , is either young & we'll forgive you for being naive , or you're someone who would probally die for Bush , & with his gratitude , he'd probally give your widow half of what he / she deserves . He's done that to a hell of alot of young solider's he has sent to fight his war , solider's with children . . . . wow , he's a great president .
12791|5|This movie was absolutely fantastic . As a movie , a documentary , and a political attack . I honestly believe that anyone can appreciate it . There were times when he took cheap shots at Bush , or times when he made is point through innuendo and not a solid case , but no one ever said this film is supposed to be fair . Conservatives are screaming propaganda ( which is histrionic because , with the above criticisms in mind , he still uses pure facts ) But even if it is ; I say its about time . After all , conservatives have a 24-hour propaganda machine called Fox News , which lies and distorts information , but tries to passs as a legitamate disperser of news . The opposition finally has a voice . . . . the true lovers of democracy-true patriots finally have a voice ! Hurray for Michael Moore for breaking down the Bush Barrier of lies and deception !
12800|5|Just read : Fast Food Nation : The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser
12801|5|I cited this movie in my rating of McDonald's food not too long ago , so my rant toward Mickey D's still stands . But , in reaction to this movie , every one should go see it . For their health . Not that I eat much fast food , but since I have seen this movie it is unlikely that I ever will again . I have even thought of buying a copy on dvd to control my late night binges . Trust me , this movie will make you feel like a fat american , even if you are not . Most of all , I was impressed with the amount of research that went into this movie . Its claims were grounded and arguments were well supported ( though there was no main underlying statement such as DONT EAT FAST FOOD ! ) . The best part about this movie is that it has sparked neccessary change . Since the movie was released McDonalds no loner offers Super Size Meals and I am noticing more and more articles focusing on an individual's portion size for a meal . I know that many of you refuse to give up that big mac and fries , but I still urge you to watch this movie , it really might change your mind .
12808|5|Throughout this marvel of a movie I kept thinking 'this is insane , ' 'there's got to be a better way'--what these penguins go through was somewhat hard to watch : as winter approaches they wobble 70 miles to thick enough ice for breeding ; then after passing off eggs to males , the famished females walk the 70 miles back to sea to get food and come back to feed babies ; meanwhile , males go 120 days with no food , staying huddled thru brutal , pelting ice storms ; these treks go on for 9 months of the year before going back 'home' to sea ; though the movie sensitively handles the dead stragglers , prey , eggs , and chicks , it will be sad for children--not that that's a bad thing ; stay for closing credits to see clips of how both panoramic and close-up shots were taken . Morgan Freeman narrates .
12809|5|Interesting for adults and acceptable for the whole family . Well narrated and I know have a profound respect for these birds ! ! !
 1281|5|Great film with great acting . Quentin Tarantino is awesome , as are John Travolta , Willis , Thurman , Jackson , Keitel . Rhames best film ! Great cast . Very original script and format . Good cinematography .
12814|5|One of the best documentaries I've ever seen . . and one of the most touching and disturbing . It basically follows the arrest ( on questionable evidence ) and trial of three teenagers in West Memphis , Arkansas for the horrific mutilation murder of three young boys . If you're from the deep south you might be offended by all the obvious stereotypes . . although none of them in this film are created for effect . This is life as it really is for the people in question . Rusting trailer parks peopled by folks on welfare wearing trucker hats . The ubiquitous cigarette butt hanging from their lips . Their sad smiles revealing missing teeth . You feel for these people embroiled in something beyond their limited ability to comprehend . A moving and powerful movie .
12815|5|It might discourage some to describe this extraordinary 2004 PBS documentary as " the real thing " about the events of a decade ago related in 'Hotel Rwanda' in 2004 . And yet , there is so much about the filmed testimony that is objective and factual that the narration and the filmed records allow the viewer to acknowlede objectively the responsibilities of the local and foreign parties who , through direct action or inhuman apathy , were involved in the tragedy in one way or another . Remarkably fair in its judgment of the abysmal and abundant human error , this is an unforgettable experience .
12817|5|An amazing film . . . a great socio-economic film , sports is merely a backdrop to larger issues . . .
12818|5|I'm not a big basketball fan but I don't think I had to be to appreciate this doc . It was bittersweet and I felt true sadness for both of those kids .
12819|5|This flick should be shown to any kid that can play a lil ball , who thinks he's strolling to stardom . Keep 'em humble / keep the odds in perspective . As far as the flick itself - it's great . Did not want it to end . I wanted to keep following them after their high school days . I thought Arthur had more potential as far as skill , but was more raw . A little polish and he could've been awesome . Of course he never had the chance though .
12821|5|Really , really cool . This was a great documentary . It used direct quotes from the awesome book and interviewed the climbers who wrote it . It actually took you up the mountain and showed yout the void . It kept me entertained the entire time . Comes highly recommended .
12822|5|I've been waiting for this movie to come out for 15 years , ever since I read the book of the same name in the late 80s . The true-life story of 2 British climbers in the Andes in 1985 who summited Siula Grande , a 21 , 000 foot peak , then suffered a horrific catastrophe on the way down . That Joe Simpson survived to tell the tale is beyond belief . The book is extremely well-written , and one might think that the weight of expectations would make any movie pale in comparison . But this movie delivers . Sticking closely to the original tale , in a unique blend of documentary narration by the principal characters , coupled with reenactments so superb and realistic that you forget you're watching a movie , Touching the Void will stick in your mind long after you leave the theater . One of those rare movies that sucks you in so deep and so profoundly that you feel visceral shudders of horror and fear as the tale unwinds . Do not miss this movie !
12823|5|One of the best documentaries I have seen . Robert Crumb was the king of underground cartoons of the 60s-70s and later-his art was seen not only in papers and publications , and featured in his own comic books , but also made it on to album covers . His twisted humor went right to the core of social satire . In this movie you meet him , his brother and mother and several celebrities he dealt with . It is both sad and funny . After the movie was made his brother ( who was also a talented artist ) committed suicide .
12824|5|This was a GREAT film . I liked it even though R . Crumb himself is a disgusting person . Living with mom , brother and what-17 cats ?
12825|5|A well done , most amusing and revealing view of one of the major figures of American underground popular culture . The main point of the film : dysfunctionality in the family often leads to genius in the progeny , and usually engenders gross eccentricity , to boot . When you see this film , you can't help but feel so sorry for Crumb's brother Charles , who was a very significant influence on the cartoonist .
12827|5|A very fine film about a true American genius , one of the greats of jazz history . What a strange character ! ! ! But what a magnificent musician . . .
12829|5|Good documentary with the real Shane , love the Pogues , opened my eyes a little , he was crazier than I thought . . got to be a 5 . . . . . . . . . .
 1283|5|This is my favortie movie ever ! Every seems to think that Travolta was the man in this movie , But Samuel L . Jackson is the Bad Motherf * cker . Also , Christopher Walken , Harvey Keitel , Quentin Tarantino give excellent performances .
12830|5|A very good movie about a man seemingly bent on his own destruction . Good music movie . Worth seeing but not for the very squeamish .
12831|5|Outstanding music movie . Sarah Share does a great job of walking the tightrope between glorifying and villifying the genius and self destructive bent of Shane MacGowan . You leave the movie not exactly sure what to think - will he be dead in 5 years ? Will he go sober ? Can he go sober and still be himself ? However the story ends , the life he has lived to date is interesting to say the least . . . if you like the punk rock scene , and you enjoy the Pogues , you should not miss this movie .
12834|5|Even a non-Muhammad Ali and Norman Mailer fan ( like me ) , can look forward to seeing them shoot off their big mouths in this epic , particularly given how Ali and Foreman have changed since this fight of the century when the world stood still .
12835|5|awesome . . . very funny
 1284|5|John Travolta comeback movie . Samuel L . Jackson was also great in this movie . Great cast .
12842|5|Award-worthy documentary of the dance movements clowning and krumping , with both presented as alternatives to gangbanging . Moviegoers are drawn into the lives of individual dancers , including Tommy the Clown who started it all . Music and butt-popping dancing throughout , with the highlight being a large arena competition . If offensive language bothers you , it's mostly at the beginning and not gratuitous . If Christianity bothers you , it's mostly at the end and also not gratuitous . Inspirational ( Rize ) without being sugar-coated ; plenty of cause for both laughing and crying . Hopefully , some grant $ and job offers will come out of this . . . and understanding and hope .
12847|5|I have seen the movie it was a very good movie . Ther are 7 other people how rated this way don't they say anything .
 1286|5|Another great director , Quentin Tarantino . I love the way the scenes jump around in time . I think movies that mess with your mind are hecka sick .
12860|5|At first i didn't like it but the more i watched it the more i got into the characters and the storyline and how hope plays a big part in this movie . Best prison movie hands down !
12862|5|One of the few perfect films I've seen . Absolutely flawless .
12863|5|Definitely one of my top 10 . Even though I dont care for Tim Robbins' politics , his portrayal of Andy was superb . At first I had a hard time accepting him in that role ( in Steven Kings short story , Andy is small in stature , not tall like Robbins ) . Morgan Freeman was even better . Freeman is a one of the greatest actors ever and this is one of his best pictures . I have the DVD and find myself watching it a couple of times a year just for inspiration .
12869|5|Are we watching the same movie ? This movie is very good . Great story line , originality , and conclusion .
12872|5|This is a must see for any movie fan . Great story , great acting , and great music .
12874|5|A great work of art by Stephen King . Brilliant , a Masterpiece . Very well written and thought out . The storyline is extremely tight & well constructed . This film should have won the Oscar for Best Picture but unfortunately it came out the same year as Forest Grump . Forest Grump won the Best Picture Oscar because it was oatmeal for the masses and could be digested easily . When I saw Shawshank Redemption in New York City you could hear a pin drop . That's how captivating a story it is . When the sadistic prison guard captain beat the new inmate to death the audience's eyes were glued to the moviescreen . The film speaks volumes about feelings of despair and hope . The Count of Monte Cristo would have been proud of Andy Dufresne .
12875|5|Steller movie , a must see for anyone , and I don't give that out to every Tom , dick , and Harry movie Hollywood chruns out . Oh , and Ignatius , I highly recommend King's Dark Tower series if you're looking for good reading . : )
12876|5|The only reason this movie did not win the BEST MOVIE Oscar was because it was released the same year as FOREST GUMP . Tough competition . I may not agree with Tim Robbins politics but he sure is one hell of a good actor . Morgan Freeman is one of the all time greats . Morgan Freeman's son is also in this movie . He played one of the cons yelling at the new arrivals near the bigining of the film . He was the one acting like he a had a fishing rod . In the Novella APT PUPIL ( also by Stephen King ) it is mentioned that Andy Dufrense handled the stocks for the lead charector in the story . Nice to see a little continuty in King's work .
12878|5|An amazing and life-affirming film . What's more amazing is that it did not win Best Picture the year it was released . It apparently didn't do amazing box office business when it came out but made an incredible comeback when released on video . The title put some people off but word of mouth spread and it became a bonafide blockbuster . Well-deserved . Great ending too .
12879|5|I rented the Shawshank Redemption because I had taken an online survey about movies I liked and disliked . this movie forum would then take my ratings of movies and reccomend movies they thought I would like . I was surprised when they said the Shawshank Redemption . Me , like a movie about prison ? I was sure they must be mistaken . Well I rented it and loved it . Tim Robbins , was great as the man who was wrongly accused of a double murder . He ended up in prison for decades . Morgan Freeman was also good as a fellow prisoner . I was expecting a movie about lots of violence and was surprised to find out it was more about how tim Robbins character survived his decades in prison and his victory in the end . A bit too long but a great movie .
 1288|5|It's a great movie . John Travolta is the best actor . Its got awesome acting and an awesome plot . It's definitely a classic and everyone who is living should see this movie . Go on the web and check it out sexy people !
12880|5|Mozda najbolji film koji sam ikad u zivotu pogledala . . . ! ! ! ! ! ! !
12882|5|This movie is amazing . It is one of the best movies ever made , and my favourite movie of all time .
12883|5|this movie is with out a dout the greatist move of all time , this movie will chang you for ever after you watch it !
12886|5|Superb well crafted film about an innocent man Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the changes he goes through while in prison . Standout peformances by Robbins , Morgan Freeman , James Whitmore and Bob Gunton as the cruel warden . The movie has rightly become a modern movie classic .
12893|5|I can't listen to the same song twice in a row without getting a headache but I can watch this movie Over and Over and Over .
12894|5|Excellent story of an innocent man in prison , and the people around him . I enjoy this movie any time it come on . Tim Robbins is great , and place his character with a good amount of depth . Morgan Freeman is excellent . Stephen King had a great story .
12895|5|SUPERB ! A life affirming movie with a message of hope and redemption . Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins as well as a fabulous supporting cast make this a movie that will endure .
12896|5|A terrific movie . Although some may find it slow , I say those people are slow . The only movie that Tim Robbins was good in .
12897|5|Movies touches a lot of issues beautifully -- prison brutality , business corruption , religious hypocrisy , what enables rehabilitation , the power of keeping hope and believing in oneself . Very inspiring and teaches some valuable life lessons .
12898|5|Overshadowed by Forest Gump that won EVERYTHING that year , but by far one of the greatest movies made .
12899|5|It's rare for a movie these days to take it's time telling a story , and that's what Shawshank Redemption does . This film is very well written , well acted and compelling from beginning to end . There's no explosions , there's no silliness , it's just a simple , warm , honest , comtemplative film with a story that brings the audience along with it . Great movie ; you'll think it ends too quickly .
 1290|5|Like all his movies , Quentin Tarantino once again gives you many different ways to look at a movie . In order to fully grasp the concept you must not only watch the movie , you must try to relate with each character and figure out what is in the case .
12900|5|I never understood the hype about this movie until just recently when I caught the last half of it on TV . Incredible storyline , excellent acting , and very moving without being sappy . The script , especially the monologues for Morgan Freeman's character , was extremely well written . Great movie !
12901|5|An absolutely great movie . If you haven't seen it , you're missing out .
12902|5|one of the best drama movies ever
12903|5|Everybody loves shawshank , it's dificult to see anything beating it for the 'peoples' choice for best film of all time . Brilliant from start to finish . The unfolding scenes from when Andy is sat in the yard talking to Red , just let out from solitary confinement , to the films close are as satisfying to watch as anything in cinema .
12904|5|I can honestly say that I have never heard anyone say a bad thing about this movie . The message about the triumph of the human spirit contained in it is universal and seems to appeal to everyone regardless of gender , age , race , etc . Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give fantastic , heartfelt performaces along with their exceptionally strog supporting cast . This is a timeless movie that gets it right on every level - a wonderful version of Stephen King's excellent story .
12906|5|By far the best movie ! ! ! This is the kind of movie you can watch once a week ! ! !
12907|5|Outstanding ! !
12908|5|This is my favorite movie of all time . I own the DVD and have watched it maybe 25 times . My family laughs and makes fun on me when I watch it . I ve never really been able to determine what draws me to it . I have noticed that there are no women characters in the movie other than incidental ( the opening scenes where his wife is shown , some of the jury , the last parole board has a representative , the board house woman and the grocery store ) , thus all the interaction of any substance is between men . This is not what I usually watch . Somehow the isolation and introspection by the characters seems important . I usually have plot criticisms of movies such as when characters do things that are nonsensical , something requires 1000-to-one odds to work and works , or cars roll over and there is a small nuclear detonation to enhance a scene . But the plot in SR is flawless . I ll read some more of the reviews .
12909|5|The greatest movie I've ever seen . There's nothing I can say that hasn't been covered by the other reviewers . It's touching , it's interesting , it's clever . It's just a damn good watch . This is a movie I could watch over and over for eternity . Great acting , great plot . Just great !
 1291|5|This movie is twisted but ingenious ! My favorite part is where Christopher Walken tells the little kid about the story of the pocket watch . I mean up his ass for two years , that's funny .
12910|5|Truly one of the best movies ever made . I was one of the few who saw it in theatres and feel better for having seen this cinematic masterpiece on the big screen . I've viewed the movie countless times since it was released and i'm still moved beyond words with each screening . Everything else out there is just a movie , this my friends is art .
12911|5|Tim Robbins is my hero . This movie rocks .
12912|5|This film is amazing and stunning . The first time I watched it I was left breathless . The score is beautiful , the performances outstanding , and overall a truly brilliant film . A little audience-friendly , but who really cares when there is a great film like this .
12914|5|awsome , I can't say any more . a modern classic
12915|5|This is tied for my # 1 movie with One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest ( 1975 ) .
12916|5|I LOVE this movie , its my favorite movie of all time .
12918|5|Definatelly one of Frank Darabont's greatest work . His adaptation of Stephen King's original novel was just fabulous . This movie really speaks to the soul , and people can learn alot from this masterpiece .
12919|5|This is definitely one of the best movies , uhhhhh . . . . . ever . Entertaining and thought-provoking . I saw the movie , then read the short little story that created the three hours . Maybe because I already knew the story , but the movie was better than the book . Not many movies do that . It actually made me want to become a penologist improving America's prison system .
12920|5|I consider this a perfect movie . Fantastic writing , great acting , great vibe . Freeman is fantastic . My all time favorite flick ! A must see . . . and do not let anyone spoil the big surpise !
12921|5|Another incredible movie ! When I first heard what it was about , I have to admit , I was not eager to see it . I rented it when it came out on video . I wish that I had seen it in the theatre . Not for the graphics ( wasn't any really ) but just to really get into the movie . To see it much better on the big screen . All of the actors did such an incredible job on this film , I thought they all deserved an Oscar !
12922|5|As much as i do not like Tim Robbins i must say that this is the masterpiece of his career so far . This movies could have been another jail-break film but Tim and Morgan Freeman ( and the rest of the cast of inmates and officers ) carry the weight of the drama with deep passion to the point in which you actually feel pity for the prision men . The scene where Tim finally reaches freedom is a powerfull and memorable one and the kind you have to rewind over and over .
12923|5|This is one of the most incredible films I've ever seen . It is easily on my top 5 list of favorite movies and were it not for Forrest Gump , I Think it would have won best picture . IF you have not seen it , do so as soon as possible
12924|5|I think that this movie was absolutely excellent ! , The way he seemed to feel like he had nothing left , and then as if out of nowhere he felt he got the redemption that he deserved . I think that it was just soooooo good ! ! ! !
12926|5|I believe The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever created . The movie was directed extremely well , it has excellent cast , and above all , it has brilliant and wonderful story . It is funny , sensitizes , sophisticated and has an astonishing end - every thing a movie should have . When I first saw this movie , I was very impressed , especially from its end . From that time , I manage to see it at least ten times and each time I saw it again , I enjoy it like I haven t seen it at all ; I even see things that I haven t noticed before . I think that everyone should see this movie at least one time , and if you haven t seen it yet , go see it - I promise you that you ll enjoy every second of it .
12927|5|You either get busy living , or you get busy dying . This is a tightly crafted movie you have to see twice to fully appreciate ; things you learn at the end of the first viewing change the way you interpret the events from earlier in the movie . The only flaw IMHO is Stephen King's stilted views of prison guards ( too cruel ) and prisoners ( many too sheepish ) .
12928|5|i love this movie , it's got an excellent storyline ! ! ! ! !
12930|5|This is one of my favourite movies . I've seen it a million times and I never get sick of it . All of the actors in this movie do a great job and the movie keeps your attention all the way through . Definitely worth seeing .
12932|5|This is the 2nd of only a few movies that I own on tape . For some strange reason I'm fascinated by prison movies , and this one is good . Very clever scenes and ideas are only one charm of this movie . And , it had a happy ending .
12933|5|I enjoyed this movie . Shawshank Redemption was very well developed . They put a lot of time into developing each character . It held my attention until the end and had a very unique ending . I would definitely recommend it .
12934|5|This movie is still beloved , I know . What a smart movie . Maybe the actor in the movie is described as a bright young man . When he hid the hammer in the Bible I was impressed . I liked the relationship between the main actor and the African American old guy . It's a warm relationship .
12935|5|Great movie ! ! ! !
12936|5|THANK YOU ! FINALLY ! A deep meaningful movie aimed at the men ! This movie opened my eyes in more ways than I could possibly express in this review . It teaches you the imortant lessons of love , friendship , kindness , perserverance , dreams and being non violent . This is a movie that had me tearing up at the idea of one man making such a large difference . This is one of the greater movies , I belive , ever made .
12937|5|I can't really do this film justice in one short paragraph . Brilliant story ( I'm embarrassed to say I have yet to read the Stephen King novel ) , perfect casting , powerful heartfelt flawless acting and possibly the most uplifting film I have ever watched ! If you haven't seen Shawshank Redemption yet , then do so at the earliest opportunity .
12940|5|This movie totally pulled the viewer into it . It keeps you puzzled as to whether or not the main character did the crime he was accused of . The ending is terrific .
12941|5|This is one of my favorite movies . I enjoy movies that I get so involved in that I forget I'm watching a movie . I felt anger when he got solitary for playing wonderful music . I felt triumph when he finally got books and money for the library . And I felt even better when he escaped .
12943|5|My all time favorite movie . Highly entertaining , active and sad . Full of surprises . It leaves the viewer absolutely smiling inside and out . I love this movie so much .
12944|5|Shawshank is my favorite drama movie of all time . A bit on the long side , but the awesome conclusion makes it all worth it . Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver top-notch performances in this feel-good movie . But it's not so feel-good that it's sappy , but just a great good prevailing over evil experience .
12945|5|The all time best movie . Hard to believe because there is very little action , sex or violence . Exceptional cast of characters . Extremely well written . I have watched it nearly 50 times and still get excited at the end .
12946|5|This is my favorite movie of all time because it brings hope to the audience in anything they face . The main character is spontaneous and likeable . The movie has a very good climax and surprise to it . It is a feel good movie of the decade . Very inspirational .
 1295|5|Loved this movie . I like this director . I love the twists in this movie .
12950|5|All I can say is , this movie deserves to be # 1 .
12953|5|Wow ! Written by Stephen King , this movie was filled with drama . The characters were realistic , it made me care for them . Loved the end .
12954|5|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an excellent acting job . The plot was well executed and the script was ingenius . At the end of the film you felt good . A solid film . The scene atop the roof with the beer was the best .
12955|5|Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman were great together . Two talented actors . One of the best screenplays I've ever seen .
12956|5|The Shawshank redemption was a great movie . It was a story about one man's quest to continue living even though his life was taken away . Being tossed in jail for killing his wife , Andy has to survive long enough to possibly get out or clear his name . Great movie .
12957|5|This is odd . Shawshank Redemption is actually better than than story that inspired it ( Stephen King's Rita Hayworth The Shawshank Redemption , from Different Seasons ) . Basically flawless in all areas .
12958|5|All around wonderful film . I love it and enjoy watching it over and over again .
 1296|5|Definitely one of the best movies released in recent years . Brilliantly written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and the entire cast is superb . The movie manages to both funny and shocking in a completely unconventional manner . The soundtrack is great . The first time I saw the film I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing . That's exactly what I loved about it .
12961|5|This is one of the best movies ever made ! I was forced into watching it by my best friend , and i thank him everyday ( well not literally ) for watching it with me . A touching movie about the unbreakable spirit and the untouchable feeling of hope . wonderful , even bought the book while i was in london .
12962|5|This is a movie to watch with an open mind and heart because you evolve with the main character . You're on a journey with him and it's one you'll never forget . One of the best films I've ever seen .
12963|5|This is easily one of my top 10 movies . Tim Robbins shows that modesty and persistence in bad situations can help one come out on top . I fell in love with Morgan Freeman's character for his realization that conforming to the norms ( e . g . , trying to convince parole officers of his remorse for crimes he committed as a youth ) may not be the best way to reach one's goals . Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were a fabulous match .
12964|5|It's kind of amazing that two of the best movies of the last 15 years or so are novellas by Stephen King , a man more well known for horror books ( Stand By Me is the other movie ) . Shawshank is brilliantly written and produced . Tim Robbins is at the top of his game , but it is the performance by Morgan Freeman which is the most impressive . He is simply wonderful . Due to the number of times that this film has been on TNT / TBS , I have probably seen it 15 or so times and it has never gotten old . I can't recommend a movie more highly than Shawshank .
12966|5|A beautiful movie . I like it more each time that I see it . One of those rare movies that is able to leave the viewer with a powerful message without coming off as preachy . To me , the message was that a person with good intentions can have a positive , important impact on whatever environment in which he finds himself - no matter how hopeless or unfair that environment is . Andy Dufresne touched everyone who he came in contact with , and many with whom he did not . And in the end , he was made the life for himself which he wanted . A powerful film .
12967|5|Fantastic movie .
12968|5|This movie is awsome , I watch it my first time and thought it was a very clever movie plot .
12969|5|Goodness , this was certainly the absolute best movie I have ever seen . From the acting , the plot , the directing , all the way down to the sountrack , this movie was complete .
12970|5|everyone that I know that has seen it have all agreed that this is truly a brilliant movie . . . Well acted , directed and written . Everything .
12971|5|The movie is actually as good as the novella written by King . I am usually disappointed in film based on a written work , if I have read it . However , Shawshank captured every essence . The acting was so exceptional that the viewer feels more like they are peering into real people's lives rather than watching people act . Uplifting and inspirational . I was with Andy through every step of his journey and truly felt the amazement and beauty of life that he had always known existed .
12974|5|One of the few exceptions where the movie lives up to the quality of the written story . Excellent .
12976|5|Great movie , a must see .
 1298|5|What a great movie . It resurrected John Travolta's career and includes some of the most well written and original material in recent memory . You got to love the conversations between Travolta and Samual Jackson . However , this movie is definitely not for everyone . It includes some pretty graphic violence , but none of it is gratuitous . It is also incredibly funny with some of the funniest moments coming as a result of the violence . The soundtrack is one of the best ever .
12981|5|One of the best movies I have ever seen . Great acting , great show
12983|5|Wonderful movie and the acting - superb ! Very thought provoking as well . It has a way of changing the way you view life and our particiption in it .
12986|5|I define art as something that moves you ; something you can not forget . Beyond doubt , this movie is a work of art .
12987|5|Awesome movie - almost as good as the book . The character of Red being an African American , and Morgan Freeman nonetheless , was a pleasant surprise that only added to the fabulous storytelling and rich filmmaking .
12991|5|A movie that I think gets a overlooked when the greatest movies of the last 10 years or so are considered , but it definitely belongs in that discussion . Inspirational but never cheesy .
12993|5|This movie was well-written , and the actors did a very good job . The best aspect of the movie was that it seemed like it had really happened .
12994|5|Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I've ever seen . It is an awesome portrayal of life in jail .
12997|5|Shawshank is one of the few movies I can watch again and again . It's just as good every time .
12998|5|When the hero locks himself in the prison office and plays the reconciliation scene from 'The Marriage of Figaro' over the loudspeakers in the prison exercise yard , stopping the prisoners in their tracks , transfixed , is one of the great scenes in modern movies .
12999|5|Great movie . Different from most .
   13|5|What a brilliant film ! Harrison Ford was awesome , as he was in the entire trilogy !
13000|5|Shawshank Redemption is an incredible movie that always keeps you thinking .
13001|5|If God had not created dog , this would then be classified man's best friend . The source of all wisdom ( well . . for buisness at least ) for men ? . . . I feel no man makes decisions in life without first contemplating what the'Don'would do in a perticular situation . Using quotes from this movie has landed me in hotwater many times with the boss . . . sometimes it becomes a reflex to apply a quote in certain circumstances example : after been yelled at my reflex quote to my boss was thus " I promise you either your signature or , your brains will be on this contract . . . . " ooops !
13004|5|classic . marlon brando is perfect as vito corleone . james caan as hotheaded sonny corleone was memorable . this movie was done with class it didnt need violence and blood to make it exciting . it was well written and the book is just as good if not just a little bit better .
13007|5|'The Godfather' is simply one of the greatest ( if not the greatest ever ) . This movie has it all , and anyone who has ever sat down to watch it is immediately pulled into the world of the Corleones for the entire length of the movie . With the mixture of storyline and casting , along with the light and dark , this movie captures the very essence of what filmmaking is all about and more . 'The Godfather' is art at its finest- MAGNIFICENT ! ! !
13008|5|When someone told me this was the best gangster film ever written I laughed in their face . Once I watched it , my mouth literally hit the floor as I heard my laughter come back to haunt me in what I can only describe as a resounding I told you so . This film is near genius accompanied with perfect casting , clear settings and a now very familiar famous soundtrack this all aids a very detailed account of the Corleone family , especially the Don who serves as the main patriarch of the family he loves whilst trying to balance the criminal instinct inside . We don't get to see the real Don Corleone until The Godfather Part 2 - played brilliantly by Robert Deniro . Definitely worth watching .
13010|5|the best movie ever
13011|5|the best of the best
13012|5|This is a movie that any true and dedicated movie fan should watch . It is one of the finest movies in terms of character and story ever put on screen . Superb performances by Al Pacino , James Caan , Marlon Brando , Robert Duval , John Cazale and more . The movie is dark , gritty and violent the way it should be . It just isn't about the mafia , it's about a family . The Godfather and The Godfather Part II is recommended to anyone who likes to watch great art .
13013|5|Very finely crafted movie , with not a weak performance to be seen . Caan is perfect as Sonny , and Pacino has his breakout performance as Michael . This , with the sequel are possibly the best pair of movies ever made . The third one , however , is just mundane .
13014|5|It makes you care about horrible people . . . great .
13017|5|I just saw it and am in loss for words . One of the best movies I've ever watched . It's amazing !
 1302|5|This is easily the best movie ever . good action , story , and overall its awesome .
13020|5|Nothing better has ever come out of Hollywood . An incredibly poignant story of family loyalty and betrayal .
13022|5|BEST MOVIE
13023|5|I wish the mafia would put a hit out on Callmetootie
13026|5|On the list of truly , historic , great films of all time you may see movies like Saving Private Ryan , Back To The Future , Jurassic Park , Shogun , Citizen Kane , Star Wars , or Rocky . But , no matter the movie critic of the list , The Godfather is always near the top . IN this four hour mafia epic . . . . . never mind . Who needs to describe the Godfather ! ? It's filled with power and lust , greed and ignorance , law and crime . A true masterpiece of the American Film .
13027|5|what can I say ? incredible ! Pachino and Brando are genius together . a masterpiece ! anyone who has the guts to can this movie is a bigger man than me . a must see
13028|5|This is on my Top 10 list .
13029|5|The greatest gangster film ever made . Magnificent direction , masterly acting , superb cinematography and editing . Music matches the film perfectly . Tension is palpable .
13030|5|The Godfather is mario Puzzo's best creation . It being turned into a movie is even better . The corleonne family was to good to not be televised . A must see if you have not . Very powerful . Outstanding preformance by marlon brando and al pacino .
13035|5|Dear Rudy , are you kidding ? The Godfather well done ? This is one of the best movies ever made . And the BEST move ie eve made for this genre . A must for any collection . I have it in BETA ( A special editon that was reedited by Coppala with Godfather 2 so that the story of Vito Corleone is told in proper chronelogical order . ) and VHS and hopefully soon in DVD .
13036|5|The movie that started it all . What can be said that has not been said already about this movie ? It is undeniably the best modern mafia movie ever made , and is briliantly adapted from Mario Puzo's book . Al Pacino and Marlon Brando play their parts exquisitely . If you haven't seen this already , you should .
13038|5|The Godfather was the first film that really portrayed the humanness behind the atrocious behavior of the Mafia . Before this film , the public was always fed the notion that the mob was a faceless , foreign group of monsters since the 1920's . Marlon Brando really fleshed out the character of Don Corleone ; he commanded the respect of the people around him as well as the audience : a man who spoke quietly because he didn't need to shout to be heard ! Al Pacino handled the part of Micheal Corleone with considerable know-how and his transformation was believable . But it was James CAAN's Sonny that was mesmerizing ! Everytime he was on the screen , he left you feeling anxious and breathless because he played the ticking time-bomb so effectively . Everything about this film was sheer perfection from Coppola's direction to the costume design . I think anyone would be hard pressed to name a Mafia film that possesses as much gravity or contributed more to our fairly new found perceptions of Mafia life as this one does .
 1304|5|Pulp Fiction is a classic movie . It combines intensive action with a dynamic plot to provide quality entertainment .
13041|5|I'll make you an offer you can't refuse . Watch this movie , read this book . If you're really bored stiff , it's cause Luca Bratzi just stuffed you in a trunk .
13042|5|Masterpiece . Gotta see it .
13043|5|This is a classic movie . I recommend everyone has it in their collection . The Corleone family is great . They show how the underworld is .
13045|5|Excellent . After watching it I felt like joining the mob .
13047|5|Timeless classic ! One of the few films , ever , that I can watch again over the years and still enjoy it as much as I did the first time . It had it all ! Strong story line , acting and direction . Personal standard for rating any film .
13048|5|One of Al Pacino's greatest performances . Shows the world how the underworld and Mafia work . Won an Oscar .
13049|5|The drama movie Godfather is the best movie ever . It lays out the storyline very clearly and sets up the scenario for sequels . The story is genuinely interesting .
13051|5|This is a classic of the Italian Mob lifestyle . Marlon Brando was at his best , especially for the later years . It is a long film that kept me captivated throughout the whole thing . The movie left me juiced and wanting to conquer the world .
13052|5|Probably one of the best ten pictures of all time . Incredible story , performances , photography , etc . What about the Mr . Coppola direction ? . No words about that . This movie shows he is one of the very best . Apologies for my english . I am Spanish .
13053|5|If you like the gangsta' movies , this is the one to have . One of the best movies ever . Al Pacino is a true original when it comes to playing gangster roles . A movie to watch over and over .
13054|5|Simply one of the greatest gangster films of all time . It's a great epic with a plot that unfolds in an interesting way . It is a movie I would never tire of seeing and one everyone should see at least once .
13056|5|I grew up mostly on the East coast and the midwest and this movie reminds me of my childhood . That is one of my reasons for loving it so much .
13058|5|The only movie that you can watch over and over and not get tired of it . Every time I watch I see something new . Simply the best .
13059|5|The all time best movie . There is not one flaw with this film . Every detail was so meticulously reproduced that the film's realism is enhanced to the n'th degree .
13060|5|Possibly the greatest film of all time , wonderfully written script that allows the viewer to see inside the heads of most family members , except the Don , played by Marlon Brando , who has an aire of mystery to him that isn't revealed until the Godfather Part II . The acting is superb on all levels , and the casting was done perfectly . Obviously modeled after Mario Puzo's novel , THE GODFATHER , but also contains elements of Milton's PARADISE LOST . The Don portrays a devil figure , cast out of his origanal home and achieves success in his new dwelling , also in that he is the head of an organization of men that he manipulates with ease . The Corleone Family is structured similar to that of the Army of Demons in PARADISE LOST as well . Being , without any argument , the best Mafia movie ever , The Godfather appeals to human interest in organized crime and violence . But the film is more than that , it provides a look into the American Dream of achieving success in the new world , by any means possible .
13062|5|What a masterpiece . First , there is a tremendous cast . . . Marlon Brando , Al Pacino , James Caan , Robert Duvall . Each of the actors puts in a performance of a lifetime . Second , the storyline is so compelling and well written . Right in front of your eyes , Michael Corleone changes from the innocent , young soldier into the head of the family . Third , the movie made the Mafia a part of popular culture and paved the way for future movies and tv shows in the genre . If you haven't seen this movie , you are only hurting yourself . It is wonderful .
13063|5|The Cappo Di Tutti Cappi Of Movies ! ! ! ! ! !
13064|5|An epic tale of family , revenge , and leadership . This movie has become a part of American Culture , and fairly or not , has done more to shape the popular perception of the Mafia then the Mafia has themeselves . Highly recommended .
13065|5|coppola is one of my favorite story-tellers
13067|5|The movie really taught me a lot about my life and how to act .
13068|5|This is the best movie ever made . It has all the elements of life : love , family , loyalty , betrayal . . .
13071|5|Great , got to be a 5 . . . . moving stuff .
13073|5|I watched this as part of my English class during 10th grade . As I am a fanatic about world history , I thought this movie was beautifully made . Rather disturbing , since I had never seen a Holocaust movie , previous to it , that used so much detail . I'm glad that the school approved it as part of the curriculum though .
13077|5|Schindler's List was based on a true story . Obviously the people who belive that the halocaust did not happen will disagree with me . . . . Set that aside , this film is beautifully done - Steven Spielberg obviously did a lot of research into this as I don't think anything in this film is overdramatised at all . It is very disturbing seeing certain events in this film - but it only reflects how disturbing life can be . It was a story that needed to be done , this is something that we should not forget . Persecution of any manner is wrong .
13078|5|This story was hardly propaganda and certainly to any right thinking person it has nothing to do with events today . However you view anything , two wrongs never one right . As we sit here in this wonderful country , we know what the worlds media tells us . I never believe all I hear or see .
13079|5|Schindler's List is Spielberg's best movie because of how he portrays a flawed character-Oscar Schindler-and his ability to positively affect the world during The Holocaust . Liam Nielson as Schindler is terric in portraying the character who against all odds fulfilled the talmudic dictum given him as a ring after being fashioned from fillings from a concentration camp inmate's fillings : Whoever saves a single life , it is as if he saved an entire world .
13080|5|this movie shows how genius spielberg is . you feel like you live on the past by watching this movie . imagine how lifes could be that worthless
13082|5|Probably one of the best movies you'll ever see . Words fail me in trying to express just how powerful a film this really is .
13084|5|This is one of the best moives of our time-a beautiful , painful and honest look at the biggest horror in history . Spielberg is genius whose heart shines through the entire movie . Marvelous actors like Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley just break your heart . It is impossible to not be moved by this film .
13085|5|I rented this movie last night and watched it with a friend , and we were moved to tears at many points , we felt the pain of the victims , we felt the hatred of their adversaries . I don't understand the raters on here who insist on making this an Oscar or a religious issue . For God's sakes , these were real human beings , regardless of what religious , political , or ethnic background you have . These people suffered and that suffering was portrayed in a fair and painful light . I am not personally Jewish , but nor am I blind to what happened before and during WWII . I cannot believe that some people would twist a beautiful , moving , inspiring film into a political and religious outrage ! So Spielberg got an Oscar -- so what ? After watching this film , I think he damn well deserved it .
13086|5|I think , although i am slightly biased to comment on this film because i am jewish , you can not argu the fact that it is a powerful film , and filled with bold statements such as the girl in the red coat that appears at certain moments , but the film its self , which ( forgetting what it stands for alone ) is so well crafted , directed and acted , the fact that it is based on the holocaust is irrelevant , because it is so amazingly powerful , gripping , and truly amazing . A film i will always watch !
13088|5|Excellent depiction of the holocaust . Shot entirely in Black and White with a few small enhancements , Steven Spielberg should see this as one of his best works . I was touched , and was brought to tears in this movie . No one can truly understand the horror , but this film gives one the idea , and shows the best and worst parts of humanity simultaneously .
13099|5|A must see ! We cannot understand where we are going unless we understand where we have been . This movie helps us immensely in understanding where we have been .
13100|5|great movie ! praise to spielberg for bringing the holocaust to life . equal amounts of praise to neeson , kingsley , and fiennes for the roles of a lifetime . this movie should've won awards . oh that's right , it did . . . it was obviously the academy's best picture , and the afi ranked it in the top 10 of all-time best . not bad .
13103|5|When I first saw this movie , not only did it bring tears to my eyes , but it made me think about life in a totally different way . It is the perfect film about the holocaust . Liam Neeson is excellent in this film and Ralph Fiennes is also excellent while he portrays a very strange and sadistic character . This movie at times didn't even seem like a movie , more like you , yourself experiencing these scenes in life .
13106|5|Schindler's List is a well-made movie . It has a way of making the situations that millions of people faced become more realistic to it's viewers . Yes , it is quite graphic but that only makes you feel more of what is happening .
13108|5|Schindler's List is probably the most authentic portrayal of the Holocaust you can get without being a documentary . Speilberg proved himself to be a director of the highest caliber and Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson give stellar performances that haven't been matched YET . But there a few things that really struck me about this film that are astounding . 1 ) The little girl's red coat- To some it symbolized the bloodshed of six million victims ; to me it symbolized freedom . In the first scene she and the red coat appear , she is walking oblivious and unnoticed through chaotic streets like a little girl walking home from school without a care in the world but when she hides under the bed , her coat suddenly changes black and white . She has become a part of and is entraped by the dismal scene . When we see her again , she is on a cart , expired and headed for the incinerator- she no longer has to experience the horrors of what is going on around her . 2 ) Hitler is rarely mentioned and never seen in the film . He remains the unseen force behind all the evil that we observe on the screen ; the result of the man rather than the man himself . 3 ) I have never seen death scenes more authentic before . The particular one that comes to mind is the female architect in the concentration camp . Did you notice how she bounced off the ground , limp and lifeless , after she was shot ? This has drilled something home to me : I have realized how fragile and priceless life is and though we forget from time to time , we are NOT invincible . 4 ) The profound character study of Schindler and the effects war and death can have on someone . At the beginning of the film , we have a money-hungry , womanizing Nazi sympathizer who transforms into a compassionate , selfless philanthropist . I guess Anne Frank was right when she said I believe there is good in everyone . . I will always have a special place in my heart for this film and have not just observed this picture , but been completely absorbed and transformed by it !
13109|5|This is the greatest movie I have seen . No other movie has depicted , with such power , how one man changed so many lives around him . I'm not exactly fond of movies with violence or profanity , but I feel that this is a rare exception . The direction of Schindler's List is superb . I couldn't believe how a movie that starts with such disturbing scenes and ideas could end on such a strong positive side . I had forgotten all about the violence inflicted on the prisoners , and , instead , I contemplated the strong example shown by Oskar Schindler in this fantastic true story . I recommend this movie to everyone mature enough to handle the extreme elements , and to see it again when you have forgotten the valor and courage shown by Schindler in this film .
13111|5|Touching movie . Very realistic and relatable to history . Found the visualization accurate along with the plot . Historically accurate and meaningful .
13112|5|I can remember crying when I first saw this movie . It created a feeling within me that made me dislike injustice . It had a simple and yet complex plot that created emotions .
13116|5|A movie that best retells the story of the situation involving hatred amongst diversity during the second World War . Although it is quite graphic with violence , there is no other way of educating people the art of history .
13117|5|Touching , very truthful , and wonderfully played by all actors . A hard movie to watch because of the deep feelings it arises , yet a definite must see . I especially liked the idea of depicting some Germans as at least as humane and compassionate as Jews were .
13120|5|This movie was great because it gives a better , clearer view of what happened to the Jews during the Holocaust . It is informative and educational and a really great movie to watch for pleasure .
13121|5|Spielberg's epic masterpiece about one man's discovery of his conscience amid the horrors of the Holocaust . Filmed in B / W to evoke the contemporary films and newsreels of the day , Schindler's List immerses the viewer in the Holocaust experience . Unrelentingly brutal , the camera never flinches as the Nazis demonstrate evil on every scale . Watching this film would be a depressing experience , were it not for the final scenes which movingly portray Oskar Schindler's magnificent legacy . Superb performances by Liam Neeson , Ben Kingsley , and Ralph Fiennes , combined with camera work that will be studied in film classes for years to come .
13122|5|Schindler's List is one of the best movies ever made . It shows the horrors of the Holocaust and the struggle one man goes through physically and mentally to help the Jews during WWII , saving as many as he could and wishing he could save more . Beautiful imagery , it's an emotional ride for all to see .
13124|5|This film made me relize how aweful it was to be a Jew in a camp . I dont understand why the guy was hung he was doing his job if that is the way its going to be hang the guy who put Japanese in camps cause they were a fraid of them betraying them or hang the guy who dropped the automic bomb on Japan .
13125|5|Probably the most moving movie that I have ever seen . Showing the brutality that the Nazi's imposed on the Jews in the situations of the movie made me wonder how this many people could have been brainwashed to be so inhumane .
13126|5|This movie shows the saddest history we will ever know . It is the realization that millions of innocent human beings were murdered . I believe it also portrayed how people were incredibly weak to a hidden , sick power ( Hitler ) . Thus , we should be extremely thankful that we live in a diverse and free society . We will never know the true horrors of what these people went through . Sometimes we tend to forget how lucky we are , and it makes me realize that everyday we live is a true blessing . It was a truly sad movie with a most powerful message . The music , composed by John Williams also added to the emotion of the film . How he ever came up with such a composition is purely ingenious . When it was played at my school , for the rememberence day assembly , people gathered around the string students who were playing it . It was a silent and sad moment I will remember for a long time .
13127|5|Not only is this an important film to see because of the subject matter - it is also a well-made , well-acted film . I've heard so many people say that the only reason why this movie won anything was because it was about the Holocaust , and how could you say you don't like a Holocaust movie ? Well , a well-made film is a well-made film ; social statement or not .
13128|5|This movie was the most gut wrenching , moving movie I have ever seen . It was wonderfully done with just the right amount of symbolism . For emotional release , nothing could be better . I believe that everyone should see it .
13129|5|Good movie to bring home the horrors of the Holocaust . Also , it humanized the Holocaust so that young people could understand it .
13130|5|Brilliant masterpiece . A grand contribution parading before us man in his evil and man in his compassion .
13131|5|Great movie . It gives you a good sense of the WWII era . I like the fact that Schindler was different and he fought for what was right , helping to free jews , rather than imprison them .
13132|5|Good realistic , historic story / script . Awesome cast and cinematography . Camera shots were amazing .
13133|5|What a sad , sad movie but it shows one man trying his best . Though the scenes were so sad they could evoke bitter tears from the heart , it wasn't one in vain . This movie gives hope . It shows that even in the most evil things , there's hope .
13134|5|The movie was very realistic about the Holocaust . I like how they used black / white pictures to make the movie look old . It felt like we ( the audience ) were a part of the movie . They used realistic settings , costumes and weapons .
13135|5|Beautiful film . It hurt so much that it was so good . I can't ever watch it again , but I thought it was amazing !
13137|5|This is one of the best movies i have ever seen . It is harrowing and brilliantly directed . I will never forget seeing this film for the first time .
13138|5|This is one of the most powerful movies of all-time . More importantly , it is one of the most important movies of all-time . Amazingly , there are still people who deny that the Holocaust ever happened . And , each year , there are fewer and fewer people still alive who survived the Nazi concentration camps . This movie is a reminder of the atrocities ( and it really doesn't matter if Oskar Schindler really wasn't the hero that he was portrayed to be ) . It keeps the tragedy in the public conciousness and reminds us to never let something like this happen again . Sure , it is quite long and people have shied away because of the intense subject matter . Nevertheless , if you have never seen it , you have an obligation to the millions who died to do so .
13139|5|This was the most influential movie I have ever seen . It was educational and moving . It ceases to amaze me that people who went through that are still alive . It wasn't that long ago . It was in my parents lifetime . Speilberg is an incredible director and to know that it is so close to him personally , it makes the movie even better .
13141|5|heart-breaking memorial to humanity
13144|5|One of the most moving movies I have ever seen .
13145|5|The part of this movie that gets to me the most is the little girl in the red jacket .
13147|5|This was a fantastic movie . Very intense action sprinkled with touching moments .
13152|5|A marvellous movie , with an astonishing performance by De Niro , given that very few of his lines are in English . The rest of the cast is brilliant , as is the cinematography and direction . Together with the first , these are possibly the best pair of movies ever made . Don't expect much from the third , however .
13154|5|Not as good as the original but still one of the best dramas ( and sequals ) ever .
13155|5|The best of the Godfather movies . Al Pacino and John Cazale are outstanding .
13157|5|In a Hollywood rarity , the sequel matches ( if not surpasses ) the original .
13158|5|Much better than the original . It is much more toned down , and takable . The performances are amazing , and I went wild for it .
 1316|5|An awesome movie by the don of avant-garde , Mr Quentin Tarrantino . I do adore spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies ( as does Tarrantino ) and this film was a little of a tribute to both ( Even a few of the songs are by the western composer Ennio Morricone ! ) . David Carradine is of course a star from a multitude of cheesy martial arts movies and yet his performance in this movie is enigmatic , measured , intimidating but with a sentimentality that makes one empathize with him ( which adds spice to the Bride's ongoing fued with him , which is far more emotional then physical ) . Uma Thurman is powerful in this movie , of course she doesn't look glamourous at any time during the film , often she looks dirty , sweaty , frazzled , wounded and storied which is exactly the type of raw uncompromising image her character is meant to convey , so I say Bravo ! It requires patience to view and fully appreciate this movie . This is the film's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness . The scenes meant to gradually build up tension and the ones containing oodles of esoteric dialogue will bore some but fascinate fans of Tarrantino's style . A ponderous nature and originality is something lacking in Hollywood these days and this film supplies it in bundles which is what I say makes this and all of QT's films rise above the rest .
13160|5|I think every part to the godfather aregreat ones .
13162|5|as good as the first ! just look for the reviews of the original , best sequal ever ! watch the first and second
13166|5|The best mob-movie there is . all of the crew is excellent , but De Niro steals the show as young vito corleone . The scene that micheal sees his brother dying is one of the best there is .
13168|5|This is good follow up to the first movie and I love it . I would like to see more movies .
13169|5|Superb acting . The references to Godfather I at the beginning are masterful and show how implanted the Mafia is in American life . Great scenes between Michael and Fredo . Killer montage sequence at the end ( as usual ) .
 1317|5|i dount now sis film bud i laik se taitel
13170|5|Better than the first one . Not too many movies get better than the original , but this one does . It continues from the first movie , but it seems to have more violence , which makes it off the hook .
13171|5|This sequel may have actually eclipsed the original .
13172|5|The only sequel to outdue the original . The flashback scenes were so amazing ( Signor Roberto trying to leave the office ) . The acting was perfect as well as the directing .
13174|5|The best movie ever made ! ! !
13175|5|One Of The Best Films Ever .
13178|5|The perfect vehicle for Jack Nicholson and his most memorable performance , bar none . He simply is Randell P . McMurphy , the only one who dares to question the authority of the powers that be ( mainly Louise Fletcher who plays the villainess , Nurse Ratched ) in the state mental hospital where the convicted child molester McMurphy is hiding out from the manual labor jobs visited upon him in the " real " prison . You'll laugh , you'll cry , you'll live and die with the disturbed con-artest played by Nicholson , who , in reality , appears to be much better adjusted than the staff and volunteer patients that share his wing in the psychiatric center .
13182|5|Good movie Jack Nicholson was great as Macmurphy was commited into a mental institution for being a troublemaker he continues to cause trouble by disrupting Nurse Ratchets section of the mental ward . Louise is good as the cold controlling nurse . There are a lot of funny scenes . and some sad ones as well . I like the part with MAc Murphy makes friends with the Chief . there were some good actors in this well done movie .
13184|5|Best ever of Jacks movies . . . . . 5 + all the way .
13186|5|Believe it or not my mom MADE me watch this . I was like oh god but . . . it is probably the best film that the great Jack has ever made . If I am not mistaken this was made in the late '60s . OMG I can't believe a movie can be so funny yet serious . GREAT ! ! !
13188|5|Yes - the best ever
13189|5|One of the most perfect dramas of all time .
 1319|5|The perfect conclusion to the perfect martial arts film , Kill Bill Vol . 1 .
13193|5|An all time classic emotional roller coaster !
13198|5|One of my all-time favorite movies . Perfect acting by a perfect cast . Wow .
13199|5|The only film Ive watched more than 10 times
  132|5|How disturbing this film is . Ten years after it's release , it can still keep the viewer on the edge of his / her seat . A serial killer ( Ted Levine ) , nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press because he likes to skin his humps , is kidnapping young women , removing portions of their skin and dumping their bodies . Promising F . B . I . trainee Clarice Starling ( Jody Foster ) is recruited to help find out why . In an attempt to gain insight into the murderer's motivations , Starling interviews incarcerated psychopathic psychiatrist Dr . Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter ( Anthony Hopkins ) , himself convicted of a series of hideous crimes involving murder and cannibalism . The doctor agrees to help Starling , but the information he offers comes at a price . For each piece of insight he gives her , she must answer his probing questions about herself and her past . In order for Starling to see the inside of Buffalo Bill's mind , she must open her own to Lecter's hungry probing . This is not a mystery . Very early on in both the film and Thomas Harris's novel from which it is taken , we are made aware of the killer's identity and motivations . Neither is it a police procedural . The mechanics of detection are incidental to the story's true focus , as is the character of Buffalo Bill himself . The film's central focus is the relationship between Starling and Lecter , and it raises some basic questions about evil itself . By it's nature , the printed page is able to deal with things much more explicitly , unconstrained by time or the necessities of literal presentation . Therefore , what is dealt with in an explicit manner in the novel- Do you think I am evil , Agent Starling ? -is made implicit and far more subtle in Ted Tally's excellent screenplay . It is conveyed indirectly and brilliantly through the interaction between Starling and Lecter . It is conveyed as much through their eyes as any words they speak . It is conveyed through a monster's finger , suddenly human and gentle for just a moment as it caresses the hand of a woman . Is Hannibal Lecter evil ? Maybe . Is he a pure psychopath , as the doctor in charge of his case asserts ? Almost certainly . Is he falling in love with the young woman whom he initially saw as nothing more than an opportunity to relieve his boredom by indulging in a little psychological torture ? Well . . . . The acting in this film is uniformly excellent . Everything about it , from the writing on down to the haunting score , works together to draw the viewer in quickly . The climax , in which Starling blindly stalks the killer in his dark basement while he , in turn , stalks her with the advantage of night-vision goggles , is one of the scariest on film . Watch this one with the lights off !
 1320|5|Great movie . The first one was purely a martial arts flick , this one had some more Spaghetti Western influences .
13201|5|Excellent story and acting by Jack and Louise .
13202|5|i love this movie . jack nicholson is brilliant
13203|5|GREAT GREAT GREAT ! ! ! !
13204|5|Holy Loved God ! And imagine , the book is even better . i liked the book better than the catcher in the rye
13206|5|great acting , story line , very emotinal . I loved it
13207|5|This is tied for my # 1 movie with The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) .
13208|5|incredible movie . outstanding job by jack nicholson . a definite must see . i reccomend this to the older crowd .
13209|5|My 3rd favorite movie of all time . A timeless classic . -Scarface
13210|5|Fantastic film . I read the book years before I had seen the film ( I recently purchased it ) . Of course it doesn't totally follow the book , but they usually have to be slightly adapted for the large screen . Jack Nicholson has such an enormous screen prescence and always seems to be a down and out rebel . Danny Devito was really good as Martini ( I didn't realise it was him because he was smiling ) . Christopher Lloyd was brilliant as well . The Nurse wasn't quite as I expected ( after all , she was supposed to be top heavy ) . But other wise it was fantastic . The man who played Billy was really moving and did the stutter really well ( If you want to see him in something else , watch the X-Files espisode called 'Beyond The Sea' , he's the prisoner who has visions . Definately deserving of 5 stars .
13212|5|Excellent portrayal of a mental asylum and the struggles people face if they are different . Good reading , but quite depressing .
13216|5|This movie shows us there exists only a fine line , at times , between sane and insane . In addition , what is considered insane is a matter of opinion and decided by a few people ( psychologists ) , which can be dangerous . For the time , the movie brought people into the institutions for the mentally ill , and showed the terrible conditions and primitive techniques for rehabilitation . The main character also has his own delusions when he believes he knows best what's for the mental patients and trys to force them iont society , and finds they breakdown . He realizes some people really do need to be institutionalized .
13219|5|Classic tale from Ken Kesey's classic novel . Jack Nicholson gives a stunning performance . The characters seem real and the script is flawless .
 1322|5|KB PT 2 was great . But not as great as PT 1 , which I put in my all-time Top-10 . The first had a bit more action ( The Bride's battle with the Crazy 88s was the greatest fight scene I ever scene in cinema ) . Further , the music was far superior . I did not think it was possible , but there was a 3-minute stretch where my eyelids started to get a bit heavy . On the positive side , the blood and cursing in Part 1 was a bit over the top ; I actually think I could get my wife to see part 2 . I also loked the film noir treatment in Part 2 . Finally , I have always admired David Carradine and he does not disappoint . One thing I'll say , Uma Thurman was impressive both in acting and her mastery of the martial arts . Can you imagine Julia Roberts as the Bride ( I can't do that . Where's my cigarettes ? ? ? ! ! ) Ms . Thurman deserves an Oscar Nomination . Is Ethan Hawke out of his gourd to fool around on her . Kill Bill 1 and 2 were great cinema . Loved it ! ! ! !
13220|5|A superb movie from an excellent book . Not only is the best movie from the 1970's , it's one of the best from any era .
13222|5|One of the best movies ever made ( along with The Graduate and Citizen Kane ) . But do yourself a favor and read the book first . Kesey's one masterpiece is a wild ride , and familiarity with the complexity of the book will only add to your enjoyment of the movie .
13225|5|Great movie . Dustin Hoffman does a great job acting as an autistic-savont in this movie . He deserved the Oscar he won .
13227|5|A wonderful movie . A selfish young man finds out he has an older brother after his dad dies . His brother Raymond is autistic and lives in an institution . Rayamond has inherited all the money . Charlie kidnaps his brother in hopes of getting his cut of the money . they go for a 2000 ride to California . Raymond turns out to have savant capabilities in memory and counting . he uses his brother to get some money in Vegas . the good side of this movie is Charlie learns that Raymond cannot change . So Charlie has to change for his brother and do what is best for him . this movie is funny , sad , and heartwarming . Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job playing RAymond the autistic man . I have a relative with autism , I feel they handeld this movie dealing with autism with fairness without making fun of those with autism .
13229|5|One of the only Tom Cruise movies I liked . Dustin Hoffman plays his role perfectly as a mentally handicapped man who's greedy brother kidnaps him from the home that he'd been living . Hoffman's character is an idiot savant , his brother kidnaps him in hopes that he will get his brother's share of the estate that his father left him , that he felt was rightfully his . They travel across country together and Cruise learns who his brother really is . You almost like Cruise by the end of the movie .
13230|5|Uh oh , 12 minutes to Wapner .
13231|5|A unique important film that-if anything was underrated ; probable the best performances by Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise .
13234|5|kick
13235|5|Phenomenal movie that never gets old .
13239|5|Really a masterpiece with superb acting by Dustin Hoffman . Tom Cruise was very good too . It brought all kinds of emotions to the surface , showing what this mentally disabled man went through and how his brother helped him . Super !
13241|5|Cruise is good in this film but this is definitely Dustin Hoffman at his very finest . He creates for us a sweet little character trapped inside his own mind and as harmless and likeable as small puppy . In the process we also get a rare look into the world of autism and the frustrations family members and caregivers can come to feel . This is a movie with heart and soul - the tale of two brothers and coming to terms with emotions and situations you can t change . My favorite Raymond Babbitz moment is when he is standing in the gigantic window in the Las Vegas hotel room and looking out on all the lights . The shot is wide and from the back and Hoffman looks very small and alone . With his head tilted to one side he quietly says , Very sparkly , very twinkly . That to me summed up Raymond Babbitz very sparkly , very twinkly , and very much alone . What a great film .
13242|5|Love , sentiment , change . . . this movie has it all
13243|5|Loved it ! Tom and Dustin both did beautiful jobs portraying Raymond and Charlie . I totally believed that Dustin Hoffman was like that , even though he wasn't .
13244|5|Wow . Dustin Hoffman did an excelent job . This is another actor who can be whatever he wants to be . Wasn't it he who dressed up as a woman for one of his movies ? That's what I admire most about the guy . He can switch from one character to another so easily . I think this movie really showed his talent to the public . Wonderful , wonderful . P . s . -Edward Norton can do an excelent immitation of Dustin Hoffman in the Rain Man . . .
13245|5|Dustin Hooffman was fantastic ! I don't believe anyone else could've played that part as well .
13247|5|Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise did an excellent job acting in this film . The movie really pulled me into their lives . I really enjoyed how they put their gifts to good use and made some money in Vegas . The dialogue was great , and how Mr . Hoffman didn't end up with a speech impediment after the film was finished is surprising . Yeah , K-Mart , 400 Oak St . . . .
13249|5|I think it was an inspirational work about friendship and commitment that eventually developed between the two characters . I liked the way the characters were developed and the changes they experienced throughout the movie .
13250|5|The movie was entertaining and held the audience's attention . The movie was realistic in today's society . The movie had a good storyline . I would recommend the movie for every age group .
13251|5|This was a beautiful story about a guy learning to deal with a difficult situation and learning to love his brother . I learned a lot about autism . Very entertaining .
13252|5|Rain Man was great . Dustin Hoffman gave a tremendous portrayal of an autistic man . Tom Cruise did a pretty good job too .
13256|5|Excellent movie . Tom Cruise and the actor playing Ray worked so well together making this movie . The film draws in the attention of the viewer as well as the viewer's sense of compassion for the characters . The sensitive side of a hard working strong man is brought out by the loveable character , Ray , his brother .
13257|5|Great acting . Great script . Great characters .
13259|5|This is Dustin Hoffmans best performance in my opinion . And I loved Tom Cruise and hated him at the same time . I didn't want to the movie to end .
13262|5|For me , this is the movie in which Tom Cruise came into his own as an actor . And that in a movie in which Dustin Hoffman delivers perhaps the best performance of his career . Rain Man is the touching story of a young man who comes to terms with his autistic brother , and in the process grows up a little bit .
13263|5|97x bam ! the future of rock and roll !
13264|5|Not too often do you get a set of dual performances as great as you get from Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man . Classic lines abound , and good feelings grow in this movie . I think it ranks close to the best there are .
13265|5|This movie perhaps was good to me because of my interest in the special population ( ie those with disorders / handicaps or disabilities ) . I work w / Autistic individuals and the movie was an excellent portrayal of what these people are like .
13266|5|The 15 minute journey into hell that was featured as the American forces stormed the beach at Normandy was perhaps the most riviting and horrifyingly true to life cinema that has ever been created . The audience is right in there amongst the carnage as bodies are being torn apart and young lives are lost in the most unnatural ways . I don't see any politics being played out here , just stark , naked reality . Although the actual occurrences of DDay outstripped these terrible scenes a thousandfold , from the accounts of surviving soldiers who were there , the film comes closer than any of it's predecessors . The story is secondary to the horrors lived out on screen and Spielberg outdoes himself as a director of visuals . The progression of this great director's career has been amazing . As his budgets rise , his films seem to grow exponentially .
13270|5|This is a great movie , especially the first few minutes . You don't expect a movie to start right there , where other movies wait one hour . It is brutal and harsh , but it was good . Tom Hanks and pretty much everyone else did a good job . I just did not care for Matt Damon's part . I was so looking forward to see Private Ryan and then it was that unthankful guy .
13271|5|I don't care what any historian-wannabes say -- this is a fabulous film . It's extremely well-acted ( with the exception of Vin Diesel ) and the first half hour is so horrifyingly crisp and tumultuous that you actually feel like you're there . For some reason , the saddest part for me was not the dramatic battle sequences , nor the ending in which practically every character is killed . It's the part where the graves are shown in Normandy , perfect crosses stretching as far as the eye can see . They all sacrificed so much , and that was what made me cry .
13273|5|Great movie . Almost made me cry . The D-day part was pretty sad .
13274|5|Truly outstanding and one of the greatest combat films to date .
13277|5|I lOVED Saving Private Ryan ; the best WW 2 two film I have ever seen . The cinamatogrophy was excellent , the acting was amazing , the realizem of the film is right on , and the over all story isjust entralling and inspiring . Steven Speilsberg did a superb job . The story of a sguad led by Cpt . John Miller ( Tom Hanks ) that storm the beach of Normady in one of the most horrific days in American history . Speilsberg , by the way did a great job of putting you in the middle of this horrible battle . The sguad is afterward sent on a special mission to find and bring home a Pvt . James Ryan somewhere in the German infested hills of France . while looking Ryan the sguad begins to doubt the mission and if it is worth risking the lives of these eight men to save one . Just an encredable film that leaves you with a knot in your throut from beginning to end . I give it * * * * * stars . Content : Strong Graphic War Violence , and Language ( 16 F-BOMBS ) .
13278|5|Just after the opening scene of this movie you can already tell this is a much larger scale W W 2 . Great acting with an all star cast ; this movie puts you in the middle of one of the most traject days in American History , D-Day . After the whtie nuckly twenty minutes of that day on the beach Cp . John Miller is orderd to find and bring home a Prt . james Ryan . a squad of eight men set out though the German invested country of France they start to doubt there mission and if this Ryan is still alive . Going though the toughest struggle they have ever gone though they begin to doubt thereselves and if Saving Private Ryan is worth it . A masterpiece of a movie , Definately one of Speilsbergs best
13280|5|This rating is on the movie only- not Speilberg's politics . Im suprised someone rated it 1 just because of politics . Anyway , theis is one fabulous movie . The special effects are great , the story gripping . Tom Hanks again puts on a flawless act . The ending battle is pretty good , so's the beggining , with little battles in between . A must see .
13291|5|No words can describe this film .
13292|5|Saving Private Ryan was the greatest war movie . Steven Spielberg has outdone himself . This is one terrific film . Spielberg makes you feel the chaos of war , and let you know how it was . The filmis unforgettable especially the first 30 minutes , where they renact D-day . That was the most realistic combat scene ever . That scene redefined the phrase WAR IS HELL ! ! ! With the images of soldier lying on the ground with spilled intestines , a soldier losing his arm , and picking it up , another soldier getting his leg blown off . The movie also had a moving story line with Tom Hanks leading his squad of seven soldiers to go behind enemy lines and save James Ryan , the only survivor of 4 brothers who were fighting in the war . If you have not seen this movie yet , you need to . It is a great film , and it is destined to become a classic .
13293|5|Good enough to make you want to see to see it 10 times consecutively ( if not more ) . Very sad movie . One of the saddest movies of all time . Tom Hanks did a really job at playing his character . See it as soon as possible .
13294|5|This was a really amazing movie . It was so realistic you almost feel like you're there . It's not a movie for the weak stomached as it is a little gorey in some parts . Everyone in this movie does a great job and though it is a long movie it keeps you interested all the way through . Definitely worth seeing .
13295|5|Actually the best movie and I have seen alot . I have nightmares from the first 25-30 minutes .
13296|5|It is mind boggling the realistic effects in this movie . A highly recommended movie .
13297|5|Anyone who does not believe that war veterans should receive great benefits should be forced to watch this movie and maybe they would quickly change their opinion . Incredibly intense movie at the beginning ! I had to come out of the theatre and take a deep breath of fresh air at the end of the movie . . . wow !
13298|5|One of the greates movies I have ever watched . Great direction and very well documented . Shows the strength , wit and fear in a war . Documents family love and love for your country .
13300|5|Saving Private Ryan was one of my favorite movies . It was a good war movie and had strong plots within . The movie was not just packed with action but also spoke to the emotional side of moviegoers . It was a little long , but the quality was so good I didn't realize it had been that long .
13305|5|A lot has been said about the opening battle sequence in this movie , and when I went to see Private Ryan at the cinema I thought I was prepared - after all , I have enjoyed watching a lot of films that contain a lot of violence and it has never really phased me . Wrong ! I think Spielberg has captured the essence of large-scale conventional warfare at it's most real , short of actually being there . After the initial fight scene subsided I had to remind myself to breathe . And no , I don't think the violence is at all gratuitous - WWII resulted in the deaths of some 20-25 million soldiers and that's how it is . To soften the blow on the audience would be insulting and patronising . Anyway , the cast acts its way through the film flawlessly and I really felt for each and every GI that featured ( the Germans are rather faceless , with one exception ) . Again , the battle at the end was grueling to watch and I didn't feel its impact was diminished by having sat through the first one . The opening and closing scenes with the old veteran some may find a bit sentimental flag-waving , and the comments about Montgomery were a bit grating ( I'm English by the way ) , but the film is supposed to be from the viewpoint of one squad not a history textbook , so I can forgive that . Overall , one of THE best war films ever made and technically , I think , one of the best shot and directed movies ever .
 1331|5|Nothing like it ! True original , Mr . Pink is a legend .
13311|5|Shows the graphic reality of war . One of the best story lines ever . Awesome performance by Tom Hanks .
13312|5|I loved the historical aspect of the movie and how it depicted WWII and the battles . It also showed the personal and emotional side of the war by developing the characters to get on a human level with the audience .
13313|5|Saving Private Ryan was a good drama . I loved the way it made me feel like I was right in the trenches with them . The actors did a good job of making me feel their emotions . I think I really know what war was like because of that movie . This was one of the best movies I have seen . This was a very touching , very realistic movie . The reason I like it so much is because it is so realistic .
13318|5|In the case of this film , the plot is not as realistic and extreme as the scenery , actions / words , and the truth to the era . I personally advise that non-WWII veterans see this movie , because possibly the acting and the backgrounds are so realistic that it could cause recurring bad or even traumatic memories to the viewer , and trigger unwanted emotions from that time in their lives that could send them into tears or fear . One good side is that it does a good job in showing just how incredibly influential WWII was , and it gives the viewer a good idea of the struggles , both military and personal . We , as Americans had to endure and win what could have been history's ultimate battle between good and evil .
13320|5|Perhaps the greatest and most realistic war movie ever filmed . The opening scene portraying the D-Day invasion was so real and so overwhelming that many WWII veterans had to leave the theater . It concerned the political as well as the social parts of war . Very historical and amazing . Despite showing intense violence , it was still a stern drama .
13323|5|Though this was a gruesome movie , the message sent out was very touching . To see lives die in order to save another life is something rarely done and one that must have been hard to do . I can't believe they sent a school teacher to lead , and that the life that was spared was also the one that took more lives .
13325|5|I thought that SPR was great , I know that there are people out there that dont like seeing people getting shot in the head and seeing dead people but i thought that the film showed what really happined in WW2 and I think that it was just great : )
13326|5|The cinematography was so realistic , and the action was directed so superbly , that you felt like you were the one who was landing on Omaha Beach . It was packed with action that worked , and the story / plot reached out to the audience . You felt connected to the characters , especially Tom Hanks . The last action scene was too unrealistic .
13327|5|Saving Private Ryan is a great movie . I really enjoyed this movie beacause it is a great story . It is also based on our history . The movie had great special effects .
13328|5|Gave you a real appreciation for WWII . Really made you feel for the soldiers . Had you on the edge of your seat from the start .
13329|5|I thought Private Ryan was a great movie because it accurately portrayed war and in particular , the D-Day invasion . It meant a lot to me because my grandfather fought it WWII and looked like the old Private Ryan . It gave a new generation a reminder of how we as a civilization got where we are .
13330|5|Probably my favorite movie of all time up to now . A great plot , set in WWII and an off the hook cast . Not to mention the design and production . Stephen Speilberg keeps on impressing .
13331|5|Definitely a good movie . It projected a realistic view of what happened at war time , and how soldiers risk their lives to protect others .
13332|5|A wonderful telling of World War II . One of the few war movies that doesn't glorify war and violence , but shows it as one of our horrible failure in human society . A must see for those who crave a heart felt movie .
13333|5|SPR was a good account of history . I like history , especially history about guys in the military .
13334|5|Saving Private Ryan was a great movie . The effects and realism were wonderful . I recommend everyone buy the movie and watch it in surround sound .
13335|5|This movie was epic . How could someone not enjoy this ? It depicts what it might have really been like . Very lifelike , very cool .
13336|5|Outstanding film . It gives an amazing portrayal of war and Tom Hanks deserves an Oscar for it . It's about time WWII veterans were remembered in an incredible film like this .
13337|5|what can I say about this movie every thing that you want it in a movie is there i'll tell a thing hapend with me in the movies when i was watching this movie when the massenger man didn't help his freind I SWERE every one in the cienma that show yeld and shouted to help his friend because all of us were completly living the movie .
13338|5|A movie has never effected me as much as Saving Private Ryan . I walked out of the theater in a shock . I now have the DVD and it is just an amazing movie . The writing and directing are incredible . It was done perfectly .
13340|5|I don't know why . . but I like this movie . : )
13344|5|THE SOUND ALONE WAS OSCAR MATERIAL-MAKE SURE YOU WATCH IT WITH A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM
13345|5|Saving Private Ryan is an awsome movie . It has a great cast , great director , a great story , and great special effects
13347|5|Saving Private Ryan deserves way more than RateItAll . com's rating key .
13348|5|I thought that Saving Private Ryan was a great movie . Definitely a classic .
13349|5|Graphic but accurate !
 1336|5|Bloody , violent , and funny all at the same time . Has a good soundtrack too . Favorite scene : the infamous ear cutting scene . You'll never think of Stuck In The Middle With You the same way again after seeing it .
13360|5|forrest gump teaches you that anything is possible . it teaches you to experience life as it was said life is like a box of chocolates . . . his momma said some pretty wise things .
13361|5|What a neat movie . Tom Hanks did a terrific job as Forrest Gump a man who does not have a lot of smarts but a huge heart . I loved how events of his life tied in with meeting about four presidents . Forrest has always loved Jenny since childhood they grew up best friends . Their lives take different paths . Forrest succeeds in everything he does , he is the best runner on the football team , He was a hero during the vietnam war , He ran a shrimping busy in honor of his friend Bubba and ending up being a millionaire . etc . He met presidents and was awarded by them for different reasons many times . The movie has a lot of great special effects . putting Tom Hanks in films with real presidents , Making it appear That Dan had no legs . I like the fact that a a person like Forrest who is not very smart but a very kind caring person . falls upon success in everything he does yet money and fame mean little to him just finding Jenny [ who had fallen on bad times } and being with her is what is important , I loved how he was a devoted friend , to Jenny , his mom . Bubba , and DAn . A little bit too long but a great movie .
13362|5|One of my all time favorites from Tom Hanks . He is such a talented actor .
13364|5|Well , just call me simple and dull but I liked this movie . I just got a kick out of the sweet character finding himself in so many experiences and he never realized how diverse these things were . I also loved his attitude of never thinking he was more than he was . What in the world can be wrong with a story of a sweet , kind man in some extremely funny and sometimes sad moments .
13368|5|It's always amazing to me how liberals always miss the point of this movie- even Tom Hanks disliked the character Forrest Gump . This movie is simply about your most basic Christian belief- about caring for your fellow man and doing was is good- about pursuing happiness in its rightful place . It parallels the lives of two characters Forrest and Jenny . Forrest- dumb as a bag of rocks- processes the realities of life in it's most basic forms no matter how challenging it became he always did what thought was good- what his momma told him . His journey from a crippled child to enlisting in the military and serving in Vietnam , having his best friend die in his arms is riddled with painful events that he turns into positive experiences by doing what is good . Jenny , his love , is also dealt a horrible plot in life being sexually molested as a child . Jenny is brilliant however and ends up going to Berkley living the fads of the era and embarks on a different path . She becomes consumed by fulfilling human desire that eventually consumes her and leaves her perpetually lonely . The point being made here was that human happiness is not satisfied with prurient satisfaction but action of virtue . That this appeal to universal human goods transcended human brilliance- that human happiness was part of something greater . In the end the dummy Forrest fathers a baby with Jenny that brings her only solace in life before she succumbs to AIDS . Though being the dummy the world however is Forrest's oyster where he attains an improbable wealth and happiness that he uses to continually do good . The essence of this movie is defining what is the pursuit of happiness- what is it to be free . Is happiness about satisfying simple earthly wants or is happiness about doing what is right and reaping the benefits ? Liberals view the world in such a constricted box that they will consistently miss the beauty of a movie like this . But as Forrest says stupid is as stupid does .
13370|5|An improbable tale , but portrayed in a plausible fashion . Hanks is outstanding , but I think Gary Sinise's performance is overlooked . For me , the most powerful moment of the movie is when Lt . Dan goes for his swim in the ocean , making his peace with God .
13371|5|Original , gripping , moving , fun ! Tom Hanks was incredible .
13374|5|It is not just a movie , it is a philosophy , forgotten easily in this crazy world of ours . It is a drama about a simple man , who is ready to sail with the wind , with full gusto , just like the feather in the opening / closing musical suite . His life , the way he 'simply' goes through the turbulent times around , as well as his 'Run' , and the feather , . . they are ALL SYMBOLIC . Nobody expects real life to be like that , but it is a beautifully crafted DRAMA ( critics are U listening ) that forces U to ponder upon another way of looking at things ! Great acting , wit , direction and music ( perhaps the best cross sectional selection of greatest American classics ) .
13376|5|RUN FORREST RUN ! ! Mama always said that life was like a box of chocolates , you never know what your gonna get . This movie is absolutly hilarious ! Tom Hanks did such a good job , but I found a lot of adult content in it , and that turned me off a bit . But , I suppose thats the going rate for a good movie .
13378|5|Just an Amazing story , Awsome cinematogrophy , and the best performance Tom Hankes has done . The story of a stupid person that never does anything actually stupid . he just kinds of floats by so many Historical moments and has such big roll in history he is not even aware of . He grows up Alabama raised by just his mother barly makes into public school , but insup being on the national football league because of his ability run fast . From then on he meets three presidents , serves in Vietnam , Is awarded the medal of honor , speakes infront of thousands during a war protest , gos to China and plays in the world ping-pong championship , uncovers the watergate scandle , starts the biggest scrimpin company in America , is one of the original investors in micresoft , and runs for three years straight across the country . Obviously he has an exciting life , but after advevture always returns to his home in Alabama . An epoc film , and historicly Amazing . You will never see life the same once you have seen it through the eyes of FORREST GUMP
13379|5|My favorite movie , and the first movie I have been able to say that about . One of those movies that can be watched Over and Over again . Not one frame in this movie is boring . Also it gave Americans a lesson in History that was so badly needed . Best movie Soundtrack of all time .
 1338|5|Definitely not for the faint of heart like all Tarantino films . This action movie blasted onto the all time great lists . The superb script , excellant casting and groundbreaking editing and style make this an alltime great and in my opinion overshadows Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best .
13382|5|Forrest Gump has always been one of my favorite movies , and I'm sure that 25 years from now , people will still be watching it , laughing and crying along with Forrest . I thought Tom Hanks was at his best here . His acting in this film , or any other for that matter , is so believable and intense . Never have so many subplots been fit into the big picture so perfectly . I really enjoyed seeing history through the eyes of a man who just sees things as they are and doesn't provide an opinionated slant one way or another . I thought that his analysis on JFK was simple and actually sort of funny in the way that he said it : Somebody shot that man while he riding in his car . His meeting with both JFK and LBJ was hilarious . . . . I got shot in the butt . . . . His love for Jenny makes for compelling drama , and his friendshp with Bubba ( obsessed with shrimp ) makes for some funny moments and some sad ones as well . He goes on to run across country , run a shrimp business , play football , and do anything imaginable despite having a low IQ . I loved how Forrest was so down to earth and nothing mattered to him but making those around him happy and honoring their memory when they died ( Momma , Bubba and Jenny ) . A great performance by Sally Field as Forrest's Momma . Never before have I seen a movie that brought out all of the audience's emotions so well . This film is a classic !
13383|5|A break from the usual cliches . great !
13384|5|I could watch this over and over , and I do ! ! ! ! ! Yes , a little long , and some of the scenes are probably not neccassary , like the scene towards the end of him running to San francisco and back ? What was that all about ?
13386|5|Tom Hanks is amazing , and this movie does a great job of covering several decades of history without ever getting boring . Callmetootie is a disgrace .
 1339|5|Reservoir Dogs is my favorite movie and Tarantino's best film . Great crime film .
13393|5|Almost everything you could ask for .
13394|5|I really like this movie . Tom Hanks does an excellent job as Forrest Gump in the movie . It isn't all drama , as Forrest does many funny things in the movie .
13396|5|A superb film , Hanks is unforgettable . Direction from Zemeckis is brilliant . Sinise , Robin Wright and Sally Field are all excellent . Emotions run riot in this film , laughing , crying en masse .
13399|5|I think I have heard this moving quoted more times then any other movie since it's making . And I still laugh at it ! The movie is one of those icons that will never die . Tom Hanks performance was incredible , as was Robin Wright . I don't think that he will ever have matching talent for a movie again , or not so far he hasn't . Wonderful movie ! ! Run , Forest , Run ! ! ! !
13400|5|I remember I saw this movie when I was younger , and though I didn't understand it very well , I loved it anyway . Forrest Gump is one of the most brilliant movies made so far . Tom Hanks worked his best at being Forrest . God , I just love that guy ! Anyway , back to the movie . It's a very original and sentimental movie . Don't know how anyone wouldn't like it . That's all I have to say about that . . .
13403|5|This is one of my favourite movies . As always , Tom Hanks does a great job , as do all the other actors . The story of Forrest Gump is really interesting and it's quite funny in parts also . Definitely worth seeing .
13404|5|My fav . tied with Private Ryan . Every thing you want is in this movie .
13406|5|It was great to be able to go into a show and sit back and split your sides laughing .
13407|5|One of the greatest , most influential movie I've ever seen in my life . Inspirational to anyone and everyone . I really enjoyed it 'cause it shows what a person's potential is if they try and never give up .
13408|5|Very interesting movie . Quite long but very entertaining .
 1341|5|Great movie !
13412|5|This was a sad movie but it has that image that everyone will want to watch . It is a movie that I will always remember because the character was very interesting .
13413|5|It is a really , really funny movie . I've watched this movie twice . It means a lot that he worked so hard to keep his friend's promise .
13415|5|This movie was the most successful playing movie in the theaters . I would recommend this movie to all . I saw the movie three times and purchased the video for my collection . Forrest overcame his handicap , he did not let himself be isolated from people . His mother played an extremely good mentor in his life .
13417|5|This is a good family movie .
13420|5|Engaging , funny , sad , dealing well in both fantasy and reality , 'Forest Gump' is movie entertainment at its very best . I would even go as far as to say that it's the best film produced since the golden age of Hollywood . Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of our time who has given us one of the most memorable characters on film . I'm glad I wasn't the only one able to see his talent since way back in the 'Bosom Buddies' days and hope he goes on to make more great movies with great heart like 'Forest' .
13421|5|One of the most clever movies ever made . What a story line so original . With two of the best actors in the lead roles .
13423|5|I love this movie . Not only is it well produced but Tom Hanks shines as always . The story continues to excite the viewer . There are so many metaphors in this story that you should watch a dozen times to get them all .
13425|5|Forrest Gump is a beautifully directed film that deals with important contemporary issues . It presents issues of single motherhood , AIDS , mental retardation and advocacy . Forrest Gump is a great story of how one man with a very low IQ became very financially successful . It is a story of rough beginnings and great adventures . Forrest Gump represents the best of what a decent life can be .
13427|5|This is my favorite movie by far . It's SO funny and touching at the same time . Tom Hanks gives a performance of a life time .
 1343|5|Quentin Tarantino came bursting onto the scene with this classy and thrilling thriller . Completely mixed up , there is no time here , the times change , this is great . Watch out for a cops ear , Mr . Blonde and a knife , this film was great . After the opening sequence in a bar it took me to a sickening sight of Mr . Orange ( Tim Roth ) , and Mr . White ( Harvey Kietel ) , in a car , Orange shot in the gut and White trying to comfort him while driving a car , this is entertaining as they get . Cool . Slick . Awesome . Three words that describe Tarantino's debut . Not quite as good as Pulp Fiction , but still damn good . See now . Summary : AN EXCELLENT , COOL THRILLER THAT IS A MUST-SEE .
13430|5|The character portrays true life experiences as a disabled person dealing with these incidents and social events . I like this movie , it gives examples of how people can display respect to people with disabilites .
13431|5|Tom Hanks' personality in this movie was heartwarming . It's a movie that you should watch when you wanna' see a non-corrupted movie . The whole story plot was great because it took you in .
13432|5|Forrest Gump has it all . It is a dramatic , comedic , action filled movie . Tom Hanks is exceptional as Forrest Gump . The story is a flashback into the sixties and seventies with a super soundtrack that defines that era .
13434|5|Family movie . This is a good sentamental movie . Forrest Gump will make anyone laugh .
13435|5|This is my all time favorite drama movie . It was the only movie I've ever cried during , at least since I was a teenager . The music is beautiful and memorable . Hanks does an incredible job . Haley Joel Osment , my favorite male child actor , even shoes up briefly .
13436|5|This could be described as the All American film . It includes so much of our country's history , from Vietnam to JFK as seen through the eyes of a man named Forrest Gump . It is also a great feel and good story because Forrest has a lower IQ than most people .
13439|5|This has to be one of the best movies I have seen . Forrest , who has everything stacked against him , overcomes it to do more than anyone could dream of . What a movie .
 1344|5|terintino is a bad ass ! this movie is very smart , though a little disturbing , still great work ! although most of the actors are unheard of they are still increadable . not as explosive as pulp fiction , it is still up there , besides some irrelevent flaws it's still a mind twister . wonderful !
13441|5|Tom Hank's best performance . I don't know if he was retarded or not . I hope they have a sequel .
13442|5|This was an amazing movie . The impossible now seems possible because this movie shows a retarded man able to make it . This shows that we are all able to make it and that nothing's ever too late or too bad . It's a movie that definitely gives hope .
13443|5|This movie was a great drama flick . It was really interesting how he met so many presidents and showed up at so many memorable events in history .
13446|5|I think this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while . There were no real special effects or anything of that nature , but the acting and the story were good enough to keep all viewers interested . A great movie that I would recommend to anyone .
13447|5|Forrest Gump was a touching movie . Everyone I went to go see it with agrees that the movie was worthy of a Oscar . Indeed it is .
 1345|5|i would say this movie sparked , or perhaps solidified , a new genre of films , the ultra violence of suburbia . similar to movies before it , clockwork orange , twin peaks , and blue velvet , r-dogs looks at the weird world of suburbia and the violence needed to compete and rise to the top . r-dogs is by far tarantino's best movie . the others ones falling victim more and more to his ego and poor acting ability . pulp fiction was entertaining and decent , but not ground breaking like r-dogs . this movie lays the foundation for many of the better movies of the 1990s . although quite frankly i am sick of them now .
13451|5|Intriguing way to portray the 50's-80's via a nice but naive Forrest Gump . I liked this movie though I am more into other genres such as comedy .
13452|5|This movie is magical for many of us who like it . Robert Zemickis unintentionally creates a movie that is so poignant and thought provoking that it changes the life of those who love it , not to mention giving foreigners like me a different perspective of recent American history . Personally , I always feel positive and serene when I listen or recall the beautiful score , lines and scenes of Forrest Gump . An American classic !
13456|5|A big sprawling historically relevant movie . From talking to people , it seems like this movie either touched you , or it didn't . I really , really liked the way the movie interspersed Forrest's tragic life with key events in American history .
13457|5|This movie was great , itmade fun of the army and vietnam while showing how easy it actually is to succeed in this country
13458|5|Forrest Gump is an incredible mixture of genres . Definitely a great movie to see
13459|5|Tom Hanks is fantastic .
 1346|5|Quentin Tarintino really outdid himself with this seemingly low budget film . The storyline was great and i loved the jumping around between past and present . Heavey Keitel was the perfect choice for his part . One of the best films made in the last 10 years .
13460|5|This is my favorite movie of all time . Tom Hanks' performance was amazing , and the story was a classic . Forrest Gump has become one of my heros , and friends . It was truly a great movie .
13464|5|Forrest Gump is one of my all-time favorites
13468|5|Another favorite of mine and has been since I was a kid . This is a classic film . . . Great story full of humor and sadness .
13470|5|was my favorite movie as a kid , i still watch it on occasion
13475|5|A movie close to my heart , my friends and I were these kids , we did the exact same things growing up in the rural Midwest , hanging along the railroad tracks , getting in to minor trouble . An American classic movie . And River Phoenix was the best teen actor of his generation .
13477|5|oh my god i grew up with this movie
13478|5|Just as good as the book The Body . River Phoenix shined in this classic . Rob Reiner did an excellent job of directing in this epic on an adventure , set out to find the body of a missing preteen boy .
13479|5|There should be more movies like this one-a simple , compelling story that you will remember always . What drew me into this story is that it reminds me of childhood adventures . Although I am a female and this story is all boys , I very much identified with childhood friendships and adventures . I would see more movies if they left me with the wonderful feeling this movie does . Most movies leave me with a feeling of alienation and lost values . My all time favorite movie !
13480|5|This is one of the most amazing movies of our ( some of our ) childhoods ! It show a beautiful portrayal of four innocent boys . The acting is outstanding for these children . They were all around the age of twelve . They all had the lines memorized . This is a feel good movie that sure will get to you in that good way . You feel good for watching it . I just wish movies these days could have such substance . oh well .
13482|5|Another Stephen King book made into a successful movie . Is there any question he's one of the best authors of his time ?
13483|5|This is an excellent movie about friendship . It's what you'd expect from Stephen King . The soundtrack is simply perfect . Probably the greatest soundtrack any movie could ever have .
13484|5|I came across this movie for the first time a few years ago and it held my attention right to the end . The way the boys stick together and the things they go through on their adventure is amazing and the movie is very well-made . I look for it all the time when I'm flipping through the channels .
13485|5|Wonderful ! I thought that this was just one of those depressing 80's movies ( and in a way it was ; I wish that I had friends like that ) , but I watched the whole thing on AMC and loved it . Great performance by River Phoenix .
13486|5|This film is so poinient . The characters are built up beautifully and you really feel the hurt and friendship that is portrayed in the film . This must be one of the best things that Stephan King has written , its so sensitive , makes you laugh and makes you cry . Phoenix River was outstanding in this . Its hard to believe he was 16 . I think he's still missed as he was a very talented actor . His younger brother Joquin is following that .
13489|5|Great flick . A mellow movie by Stephen King standards , but philosophical .
 1349|5|Thw best of the Quentin Tarintino trilogy and his first . This film is executed marvolously . Everything is believable , every line a character has seems real and almost immproved . Also very original to take a crime movie away from the crime that has been commited and tell the stories through series of flashbacks for every primary character and through scenes of the aftermath . No director with a right mind could ask for a better ensemble cast to bring this picture to life . Heavy hitters like Harvey Keitel , Tim Roth , Steve Buscemi ( in one of his most memrobale roles ) and Michael Madson really make this a unbelievably good crime drama . Filled with as much humor as action . Of course this is Tarintino humor so it is a bit morbid and crude at times . There is one line inparticular that nails me every time . When Mr . Pink keeps asking Joe why he has to be Mr . Pink and then Joe's reply puts me on the ground . A must see for any fan of Tarintino or great story telling seen through the eyes of a visionary film maker .
13491|5|It's the most classic movie . I love that it made me cry when most movies are so fake these days . It gave me and understanding of young boys .
13492|5|Stand by Me is a great movie because each character is developed so well . We really get to know the boys and to empathize with their experiences . Even though my childhood was very different from any of those characters , I felt that I was able to understand what they were going through .
13493|5|My favorite movie . The acting is so truthful and the characters grow so much during the span of the film . I always cry , though I've seen it 20 + times . I believe the characters are really in the situation and have truly grown closer to each other , but at the same time further apart .
13495|5|A psychological thriller which looks into the minds of a gang of youths coming of age . The movie demonstrates wonderfully the difficult and disturbing times youths face in attempting to define themselves through history , family , and literature .
13496|5|This movie is a classic . I thought that the lead actor was so cute . It has a great soundtrack too !
13499|5|Such a great movie , excellent acting and a universal story . I really enjoyed the narrating and looking back aspect of the film . An excellent and somehow soul searching adventure of these best friends . Of course , since it was based on a Stephen King novella , there had to be that morbid flare ( their entire journey occurs because they are in search of the dead kid's body ) However , even that aspect played a key part in the movie . That kid who played Gordy did a superb job of acting . . the look on his face as he took that leach the size of a small mammal from inside of his underwear was priceless .
13500|5|This is a great movie . To me , it's a classic about a group of young boys trying to make it in their town . This is one I will always love to watch .
13506|5|Beatifully portrays friendship and the strains of adolescence . I bought the video and watch it at least once a year . Best affirming line : Do you think I'm weird ? Yeah . But everybody's weird .
13507|5|Stand By Me is a great movie . It has a wonderful cast and captures the true meaning of friendship which is something all of us can relate to .
 1351|5|Heavy on the violence but in a good way . Witty humor throughout the movie . I'd watch it for the soundtrack alone . Go Mr . Pink !
13513|5|Masterful , concise , dubious , chilling , real . Loved it .
13516|5|Masterpiece . I can't think of another character I can identify more with , from '90s cinema , than Lester Burnham . I can't remember how I got to be this . . . . sedated .
13520|5|It was a movie about a middle-aged man having a mid-life crisis . He later gets tired of people controlling him or shoving him into the background and decides to take his life back . At some point in our lives we try to regain control of ourselves and do something that makes us happy .
13525|5|I have mixed feelings as to how this movie should rank against the greatest movies of all time . I mean , I love it , but that's because I can relate to Lester in many ways . It's hard for me to see how a woman would relate to wanting to be with 17 year old cheerleaders , but it's still high on the list on this site .
13527|5|This is the greatest movie ever made !
13528|5|Entirely entertaining . Callmetootie is my nemesis .
 1353|5|A must see for Tarantino fans and people who enjoy hilarious but off the wall sitcoms . A bank robbery gone bust-a rat-enjoy the bloodbath and witty comedy remarks .
13530|5|This movie is so amazing it should be deemed illegal . It shows that the family living suburbia with the mercedes benz and the nice house and the lovely rose garden still isn't perfect inside . This movie takes it all to another level and makes the family so abnormal that it makes the Aadams family look like the Waltons . The catch phrase means more than what you are watching in the movie ( the catch phrase is look closer for those of you who don't know ) . It means when you go home , when you out , when you somebody , something , look closer . There is probably more to them than meets the eye . This movie is a remarkable achievement , and I am happy that so many people saw the beauty in it that i did . To enjoy the movie more , try watching it really late at night . It becomes so much more over whelming . I recomend this movie to every one . If you don't like it , it's still entertaining in it's own twisted way .
13531|5|Man was this a good movie . Sam Mendes - first time director - he is the big thing for the future . He directed this marvelously , and came up with a well-crafted , brilliant , sad , movie . It's music is perfect , it's acting is perfect , it's script is absolutely brilliant , and Sam Mendes' directing is great . It thoroughly deserved its Oscars , and will prove to be a classic in 10 years time , most likely making it onto top 100 film lists all around the world , I would say it will be on AFIs . I bought in on VHS , you should too . See it . I found nearly NO flaws in it . Almost perfect . I watched this with an audience , and they laughed , they were shocked , this is such a great movie . Summary : PERFECT AND BRILLIANT . WILL BECOME A CLASSIC .
13534|5|A beauty of a film . Acting first class and Spacey is terrific from start to finish . His mentor Jack Lemmon would be proud . Directing is superb from debutant Mendes . Music brilliant .
13538|5|American Beauty was truly a great film , and one of the first times I've actually agreed with the Academy on the Oscar awards . I actually hadn't heard a lot of the hype surrounding it , because I saw it before the awards . A friend of mine just said American Beauty is great . Go see it ! . I can say that it's definitely one of my favorites . You go through such a wide range of emotions from watching this film . There are many comedic parts to laugh at , and some classic lines ( like the part where Lester writes about what he does at work ) . There are also parts where you feel rage or anger ( how Ricky is treated by his dad , how shallow Angela seems to be , how much of a bitch Carol can be ) . It may be a bit of an over dramatization of how life in the suburbs can be , but it's not a far stretch and I really think it shows how bad it can be . People have some serious problems and try to cover it up with flowers , white picket fences , and other stuff . This makes me think of Andrea Yates , the woman who drowned her 5 children . The ending is great too . It's certainly gruesome , but it's not a complete surprise , due to the information Lester gives you in the beginning , and the mood of the story is actually one of hope , not of demise . Kevin Spacey is a brilliant actor . . . definitely my favorite . Annette Benning also does a superb job . . . she's so great at playing the obnoxious role of Carol . The other actors of the film did great in their roles as well , and I can't think of anyone who would have played them better . This movie is not just a drama . . . it's a drama , comedy , and suspense film . The film is never boring , and for days afterward I was still thinking about parts of the movie , and I still have discussions about it with my friends . It's such a thought provoking movie .
13539|5|To answer your question , Ruby , I think this movie is about getting what you want and not letting stupid obstacles get in your way . Life is short . You never know . . . a repressed gay man might shoot you in the head or something
13546|5|This film is so powerful that I sat down and realized just how much I connect with it . This is a straight up human movie . This is a story for real people . Watching this movie changed my entire outlokk on life . We only have so long to live . We should love life and live it to the fullest . Ricky's bag monolouge nearly brought me to tears . I'll love this movie forever . It deserves to be more than # 7 on the list . I highly recommend this movie to anyone . It's deep beauty will touch you the way it touched me . And it's true ; sometimes there is so much beauty in the world . . .
13547|5|what can i say , i loved this movie . words cannot describe how good this movie was . this movie acually changed the way i thought , the way i viewed life . amazing performances by the entire cast , best ensamble cast scince magnolia . there are so many beautiful things about this movie , like ricky fitz's bag monolouge , it almost brings me to tears every time i hear it , or kevin spacy's monolouge at the end of the movie . here is a movie that everyone can relate to , in one way or another , a movie about humans and finding that which was once lost , life . its about living again , and its not to late . people say that the end is too depressing but its not depressing at all . the ending of this movie is . . . beautiful . this is one of the best , if not the best film ever produced . it deserves best picture . a must see . sometimes theres so much beauty in the world . . . . . .
13550|5|The first time I saw this movie , I left the theatre shocked . This movie told the whole truth not only about American families , but all families around the world ! Annete Bening was stunning , Thora Birch and Mena Suvari both were incredible , Wes Bentley was unbelievable but it was Kevin Spacey's role made me love him completely , what an acting ! The role of Lester was difficult and Spacey made it to perfection .
13553|5|Out of all the films I have seen in my life none have ever touched me so deeply and intimatly as American Beauty . This film is my favorite film . I'm not just saying that , it actually changed how I saw things . I related most to Ricky Fitz the young man living next door to the Burnums . The honesty and gorgeouse story are only out shined by the powerful performances given by the best ensemble cast since Magnolia . Everytime Ricky gives the speech on all the beauty in the world I cry . It is so touching and so personal , I cannot see how people cannot be moved by its simple and never before touched message . I am glad this last best picture of the year of this decade was American Beauty . It was the perfect sumation of American life and our new found spirituality . I will always hold this film high as one of the best if not the best ever produced . It will always be in my heart . Sometimes . . . there's so much beauty . . . in this world . . .
13555|5|Justly deserved to win the acadamy awards . An incredible mix of plot , drama , humor and great acting .
13557|5|This movie takes everything that is considered taboo or nasty and shows people that stuff like that really can happen . By the end of the movie , you are definitely left w / this weird feeling , like you wish things hadn't been so bad for the neighbor , you wish Spacey's character hadn't gotten shot . . . what a good movie .
13559|5|Well , if you have read any of my other movie reviews , you will know that it is not odd that I JUST saw this movie . I did hear great reviews of American Beauty and I know that it won best picture , however , I really had no clue what it was about . I was intrigued and captivated throughout the entire movie . Shocking , surreal yet eerily possible . The characters were definitely the extreme , however I am afraid that in this day and age , they weren't too far off the mark . Kevin Spacey and Annete Bening gave extraordinary performances . There are definitely some very disturbing issues being tackled , or explored , but this is surely a movie worth seeing . It was comedic as well as entertaining and thought provoking and ironic .
13560|5|I was dumbfounded when Annette Benning did not win an Oscar .
13561|5|I loved it and could watch it again and again . Acting fab . all around !
13565|5|Excellent movie with a unique plot and great actors . Kevin Spacey is seen to be slightly mental in the beginnning and not likable , as well . Yet , as the movie continues , he is a great character whom you feel for .
13567|5|American Beauty is a brilliantly crafted film that echoes John Cheever's The Swimmer --both are cautionary tales suggesting how easily lost we may become in search of the American Dream and how difficult it is to find our way home again . The powerful ending presents a narrative from the grave as Spacey's character , with Christlike forgiveness , dies for us and suggests the existence of a path that might take us through the thicket of materialism , egotism , and sexuality that characterizes the American landscape . Spacey's character sights a higher path during the long second before death ; hopefully , we will see this path less traveled earlier in our own individual journey .
13568|5|Awsome - This movie was painful to watch for all the characters became real as I recognized then to one degree or another in my own world ! . . . Loved it ! ! Benning is great - so real ! HOT too .
13569|5|Excellent movie - it offered some interesting insight into suburban culture - often we only see what they want us to see - this movie showed what could happen if people looked deeper .
 1357|5|Great movie . Harvey Keitel plays a good role as does Tim Roth . Tarantino movies are good if you like what he does .
13572|5|This one's for you , all you Eddie Bauer-wearing , SUV-driving , suburban-sprawl-inducing yuppies who think you are so superior . Annette Bening is stellar as the woman we love to hate ( notice how the handle on her pruning tool matches her gardening clogs ? That's not an accident . )
13578|5|Well directed with a strange atmosphere . The actors were great and the dialogue was excellent .
13579|5|This movie was extremely entertaining . The narration over the movie at the beginning and end were a definaite plus . The acting was spectacular . Also , the idea to show the rose pedals instead of nudity was ingenious and added to the classiness of the movie .
 1358|5|Great film with a great cast . An extremely stark and realistic view on crime . Harvey Keitel , Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are awesome ! Very original story and format . Tarantino is a genius .
13582|5|Cinemetography , screenplay , and Kevin Spacey makes this film a must see . It takes you behind closed doors into an upper middle class neighborhood . Kinky !
13585|5|What can I say . . . WOW ! !
13586|5|An incredible movie . It combines drama with subtle comedy element . American Beauty also sends an incredible message that stirs emotion and stimulates the mind .
 1359|5|Reservoir dogs is Quentin Tarantino's best film and arguably one of the best films , period . It was very cutting edge in it's time and remains so several years of technique evolution later , and will undoubtedly continue to be far into the future . This film twists your imagination and destroys your morals and you'll love it like nothing else . GO SEE THIS MOVIE !
13594|5|This movie was well thought out . I agree with the oscar award . This movie was made very beautifully . This is one of the best movies I have ever seen .
13597|5|This was one of the most thought-provoking movies I have ever seen . The Anette Benning character really made me take a look at myself , and what can you say about Kevin Spacey-the man IS the best actor of our generation .
13598|5|This is an awesome movie . It was thought provoking and not too predictable . You need to see it to understand .
13599|5|I loved every part of the movie , especially the ending becuase it was so unsuspected . It covered a lot of topics that go on in everyday lives like drugs , sexuality , friends , relationships , jobs , etc . It really made me think about my life and how 'special' everything around me is .
13601|5|And what a beauty this is . I haven't seen a film this uncompromising in its search for truth since 1969's Best Picture , Midnight Cowboy . Sure , it's not perfect , but its audacity is exhilirating . And , it's an IMPORTANT film . Wake up , America !
13603|5|If I were speaking to the people who said that this movie was bad , I would do it veeeery slooooowwly so as they would be able to understaaaaand me . The thing about this movie is that you need to look deeper . There are layers , it is complicated--you can't look at it like you would look at the current Julia Roberts movie and just go home . This movie requires contemplation , and it is certainly not indicative of a dark place inside yourself . Please . If you liked this movie , you are able to appreciate individuality and the situations that arise in all walks of life . I feel like if you didn't like this movie , you need , to reuse the movie's tagline , look closer .
13604|5|Aboslutely loved the film . A wonderful depiction of average oridinary life at it's best .
13605|5|My friends told me it was a must-see , and they were right !
13606|5|Top to bottom a breathtaking piece of work . Absolutely loved it , especially Annette Bening because that role could have been so much less in the hands of a lesser actress ( which is almost every one in Hollywood ) .
13607|5|Wow ! I had enormous expectations still it was better than I thought it would be ! This is the most dramatic movie I've ever seen , one of the most ironic ! This is theatre on film ! Hopefully it will create a new aera where theatre people start making films ! Sam Mendes MAY become the greatest of all directors in the movie history - at least his first film is absolutely terrific ! More than anything else , it's the script that overwhelmed me ! I expected a deep movie , while it's in fact as entertaining as Todo sobre mi madre . I totally disagree that the characters in this movie is cartoon-like . Again I would compare it to the much more cartoony Todo sobre mi madre . Great acting of course . And fasten your seatbelts : The ending is like taken out of an Agatha Christie novel ! Even better than The Sixth Sense' ending ! The film teqniques is better than The Matrix , Fight Club Todo sobre mi madre added together ! A little better than American Pie , which I think is the second best movie of the year ! Hope it'll get tons of Oscars ! The only thing I didn't like with this film was actually the trailer , hehehe ! It didn't tell me much , but maybe that was only positive . It made my cinematic experience even more overwhelming ! I think it's the 5 . best movie I've seen to date , after Forrest Gump , Gandhi , La vita bella Dogme 1 - Festen ! : -D
13608|5|A little simplistic in it's portrayal of rebellion and middle-class ennui , but in these times of resurgent conformity and material crassness , it's very refreshing to see a movie promote , among other things , simple joy and pleasure . The acting is fantastic . Spacey deserves the acclaim he received ; Wes Bentley is also mesmerizing .
 1361|5|This movie is absolutely flawless . I don't understand how it is only # 26 on the list . If you haven't seen this movie , go rent it , right now .
13611|5|This is the loveliest film I've seen in a long time . A poetic testament to what is real in every human heart . Kevin Spacey is wonderful as always , and Chris Cooper , who doesn't get enough work in films , is also excellent . Keep an eye on Wes Bentley . This kid is going to be major .
13612|5|Fantastic acting , character sketches , story idea , and plot development . Spacey is beyond excellence in his portrayal of a lust-struck man in midlife , and all the other characters are almost as vibrant in their depiction and almost as well casted . The way it's told , after his death , is intriguing and it works well in this case . This is a masterpiece that will be known 200 years from now as great literature , the way we know Lady Chatterly's Lover today .
13614|5|Excellent movie . Pretty 'deep' though , so don't expect you'll understand it easily . Very funny .
13618|5|One of the better movies I've seen in a while . Don't ever let me be like Kevin Spacey's character was before his rebirth .
 1362|5|This movie has an excellent plot . It has the typical Quentin Tarantino structure where it gets started at the last scene of the movie then jumps around to finish it at the end . It comes together perfectly at the end . This is one of my favorite movies .
13623|5|shocked me the first time I saw it . . . . and I have watched it at least 10 times since
13624|5|Put your mouth on the curb ! hearing that still makes me cringe . God bless you Derek Vineyard
13625|5|A very powerful movie . NOT for the young . It doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the way skinheads and the neo-Nazi's in the country spread their hate . This film is about a skinhead who goes to prison for killing a black guy . While in prison his younger brother gets involved with the skinheads . When he gets out of prison the older brother ( Ed Norton ) trys to get him away from that . He's been rehabilitated . I've watched it 3 times and the ending still gets to me . A must see for anyone over 14 . I'd advise young people to see it with an adult , preferably their parent if they can . It's a pretty strong movie . Ed Norton has to be one of the best actors of our time .
13627|5|What appealed to me about this movie is that the focus of racism is from the other side of the fence , which is very rare in film . We see a young white racist thug and the hate he emulates from his father's view on life and eventually anger over his father's death . This hate and anger spirals as a contributing factor to his downfall and passes onto his brother . What I also liked about this film is that Ed Norton's character can see that his brother Danny is a mirror image of himself before he went into prison and he knows in order for Danny to get through life he needs to change it as hate will not conquer all .
13628|5|How can you not like this masterpiece ? I have seen it dozens of times . I never get bored of it . If you haven't seen this epic , I advise you do . Brilliant ! ! !
13633|5|An absolutely powerful movie about racism and overcoming one's own prejudices . Edward Norton is fantastic in this movie . It's disturbing and graphic , yes , but necessarily so . Definately worth watching at least once .
13638|5|my favourite movie ever . i have it on tape and i saw it about 10 times , one night i even saw it 3 times in a row . very hard movie but it has a very important message . edward norton makes the movie even better and i think it's one of the movies that everyone just has to see .
13640|5|Wow . Edward Norton is one of the best actors of all time ! He gets better with every movie he does ! God I love that guy . Anyway , the movie is fantastic . I loved how all the performers made ALL the charcters seem real . This movie shows you how hard life can be . It shows you everything until it is sure you understand what they're trying to convey .
13646|5|It is hard to think of one person who can't gain something from such an important movie . This movie will shock you awake . It gets you from the begining and will not let you go until you learn every harsh but well needed lesson . I just wish this was a manditory film for high school kids . I especially loved the beautiful scenes toward the end of the film that show edward nortan's character and Edward Furlong's character as little kids on the beach and how much wonder they each had for life . It makes the point that hatred is learned we are not born with it . I just hope those who see it don't take it the wrong way and think this film is glorifying hatred which to most of us it is obviouse enough stateing that hatred is ignorance . I want people to watch this film and have hope for humanity and one day we might unite . If you are in the mood for a movie that will move you and teach you in a very stern way this is highly recommended .
13647|5|The best thing about this movie is Edward Furlong And Edward Norton
13648|5|This is a great movie . There isn't a person in the world who can't learn something from this film .
13653|5|great movie with some wonderful talented actors . danny glover , whoopi goldberg and oprah winfrey was a natural . the best part was when whoopis character finally stood up to that mean husband of hers . you could only cheer her on as she got stronger
13654|5|Underrated 80's movie- terrific acting . A powerful drama . The fact that it won zero Oscars is still one of the all-time embarrassments of the Academy .
13655|5|I love this movie since almost every movie whoopi goldberg plays a role in is great : - ) However it is very sad but I like such movies
13657|5|I cried ! - this says a lot for me !
 1366|5|One of my most favorite all time movies because of it's ability to explore the minds of all the characters . This movie gives you a sense of passion for criminals that become vitimized and the one officer who gains everyone's trust , and then turns around and shoves it up their ass .
13660|5|Great movie ! ! ! Even I shed a tear or two in this movie , especially the scene early on when the sisters are separated as young girls , not to see each other again for many years .
13661|5|This is probably the most moving aspiring and most touching , riveting , movie I have ever seen ! It's the life of a poor young black woman ( Whoopi Goldberg ) who's sold off into a marridge where her own kids and husband hate her , but soon this woman makes her own living and makes her own revenge and prosperity . I reccomend this movie to everyone .
13662|5|An outstanding movie , just as good as the book , with great performances and beautiful cinematography . Steven Speilberg should have won an oscar for this movie , because it is one of his best . Thumbs up on the casting !
13663|5|Steven Spielberg should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for this movie . This movie is disturbing , but important in understanding our history in a realistic way .
13664|5|One of the most unforgettable and beautiful films of the last generation . Vivid portrayals all around , and writing that brings the pain , poignancy and joy straight to your heart .
13665|5|A movie that I could watch over and over and over . I loved Oprah in this . Whoopi was excellent as was Danny Glover . A real life picture from the african american view in the early 1900's .
13666|5|A really beautiful movie . Whoopi Goldberg was spectacular . That first time she smiled , when Shugg Avery was there , it made me cry . She was so raw , so real . I think that is possible the best acting I've ever seen . She did a wonderful job in very few words .
13668|5|made me cry - that speaks volumes
 1367|5|Tarantino's direction makes this movie chronologically confusing . It does however , not lack for action and good acting . Dropping you right into the story . Like Pulp Fiction , has many memorable scenes .
13670|5|Best movie of all time ! Everyone who is a human should watch this mvoie ! It's history , love , hate and victory all in one movie .
13671|5|This is my favorite movie ! The story is warm and inspiring . I loved the different stages in the characters lives . I also loved the way it ended . The music was also good .
13672|5|I gave this movie a five because it has a historic meaning . It gives a good picture of black women's past experience .
13674|5|the best movie i have ever seen .
13676|5|This movie was so sad . I must have seen it at least ten times and I still cry . The music is good . I don't know if I would have been able to survive in that time period as a woman . Whoopi did a fabulous job . This movie makes me hate men . It brings out a lot of emotions . Very powerful .
13677|5|Oprah was great in her acting and the movie has a lot of symbols that can affect our lives .
13678|5|It was a really good movie . Whoopi Goldberg , Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover acted excellent in this movie . Danny Glover abused Whoopi and treated her badly , took her sister away- but at the end reunited them back together .
13679|5|Oprah and Whoopie Goldberg were excellent in this soulful , spiritual film about women's relationships , love , sexuality and hardships .
 1368|5|timeless movie . and how perfect was stuck in the middle with you for the ear scene ?
13680|5|I read the book last week and rented the movie afterwards . It was a wonderful adaptation of the movie .
13681|5|It may be a movie with a mostly African-American cast , but the women in this story exist in all races and face the same choices . Whoopi Goldberg shows pain and strength . As she grows , so does the viewer . Oprah Winfrey seems strong , but shows defeat very well . The strength and importance of sisterhood is a message women need to learn and remember , but men need to see this too . You'll enjoy the film , but the book by Alice Walker is even better .
13682|5|One of the greatest movies ever made .
 1369|5|Several of my guy college friends would keep Reservoir Dogs poster up on their walls . At that point I had not watched the movie . I thought that it was a typical guy movie . I found Reservoir Dogs very exiting , the images are very vivid . Especially as one guy ( I think the police guy ) got his ear cut off . The movie makes you get into the story , it's not just plain killing . Reservoir Dogs takes you into a roller coaster of emotions . So , this is a very intense movie . You got to watch it ! ! !
13694|5|Great . Robin Williams was great as always
13695|5|Normally a fan of action movies , I was skeptical about watching Dead Poets Society . After I did , however , I found it to be an amazing movie with a great plot and many lessons to be learned . It hits close to home with alot of people on points of opression , peer pressure , and just plain being yourself . Robin Williams did a stellar job of portraying the very enthusiastic and very individual Mr . Keating , who's teachings lead a group of restless and discontented teens to reinstate the Dead Poets Society , where they read literature from the past few centuries . The lessons taught in this film are based upon the Transcendentalist views of famous writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson . It urges viewers to be free from the constraints of society and from the opression of worrying what others think . This movie is perhaps the best-written and acted movie I have ever seen . If you have not yet seen this movie , I strongly urge you to do so .
13697|5|really really really good
13698|5|The Dead Poets Society , in my opinion , is one of the best movies ever made and slightly underrated . Beneath the pure entertainment value of its interesting story and incredibly brilliant performance by Robin Williams , this film tells much about the soul's desire in choice of vocation versus just trying to do what's expected of us by authority figures such as parents and heads of prestigious schools . On another level I think it encourages the passion of books , poetry and reading . Besides Williams , all the other roles in the film were also well acted , and the students all seemed very real .
13699|5|One of my favorite movies of all times . I can still remember that almost dizzy / stunned ( in a positive way ) feeling I felt after going out of the movie theater the first time I saw it . Robin Williams' best role so far and a performance he will hardly ever surpass . Let's not forget that Peter Weir ( director ) is THE MAN behind this masterpiece . Many young actors went on to become well-known names after this movie . + The ending , which , as someone else has also written , is one of the best in film history ( the only one that perhaps surpasses it is in Citizen Kane ) .
  137|5|Silence of the Lambs might have scared the crap out of me , but I find it to be a psychological thriller , not a horror movie . This is probably Jodie Foster's best role and it is a shame she refused to do the sequel . Silence of the Lambs takes you into the world of a psychopath like no other movie . Manhunter is an excellent prequel to the movie .
13700|5|My favorite . Excellent message . Teaches about the power of knowledge and individualism .
13706|5|Awesome movie cast . Good editing and cinematography . Very realistic .
13707|5|I don't usually like Robin Williams , but this was an amazingly powerful film . Very well written and acted !
 1371|5|Reservoir Dogs was made before Pulp Fiction and finally got the attention it deserved when Pulp became popular . It is even better than Pulp Fiction . Great movie .
13710|5|Seize the Day
13714|5|An inspiring movie that makes you think about taking advantage of every moment of life .
13715|5|If it's got Robin Williams in it especially when it's dramatic it must be great , obviously I'm a Robin Williams fan .
13719|5|One of my all-time favorites . Superb
13723|5|We watched it in social studies class . . . there was a bit of an issue getting us allowed to watch it because of language or whatever but we ended up seeing it . I liked it a lot . Good movie , good plot . I think it was realistic , but they didn't go overboard on the blood and gore trying to get more viewers , or however they do that . . .
13726|5|This has got to be one of the best war movies of all time . It beats out The Patriot by a long shot . This film had all the goods nad presented a realistic re-enactment of the rise and fall of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment led by Col . Robert Gould Shaw . As a lover of history , I knew that I had to see this movie when I first heard about it , and I was not disappointed . The characters were all perfectly developed , and the buildup to the climax was phenominal . Not to mention the wonderful acting by the all-star cast which included Matthew Broderick , Denzel Washington , Morgan Freeman , Cary Elwes , Jay O'Sanders and others . I enjoyed seeing each of the characters evlve in their own way : espescially that of Denzel Washington , whose character was so cynical , hateful and spiteful at the beginning but in the end we learned his true feelings of respect for the brave men fighting beside him . Glory is a moving , inspirational film which shows that a true patriot is one who defends his country even when it had wronged him . A true patriot is one who tries to fix the wrong . And that is exactly what the men of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment helped do . A great movie !
13727|5|The best and most captivating civil war film to date . Denzel Washington should have recieved an oscar for his performance . One of the few films anymore which is inspiring and very heroic .
13729|5|wow , is that farris bueler ? oh , nevermind . this movies is by far my favorite war film , very good acting and insane reality . I loved it .
 1373|5|Excellent movie . At times you weren't sure who to feel sorry for , the good guys or the bad guys .
13730|5|Although I watched Glory when I was younger , I have to say that it was one of the most memorable movies of my time . It's drama scenes were touching and the theme of the movie was good .
13731|5|I thought that Glory was a great movie , and it expresses what the black soldiers had to go through during the war .
13733|5|Excellent film ! It was very touching . A chance for many African-American male actors to shine . It was a historically based film that was semi-accurate . No unnecessary battles / bloody scenes . At the time of release , it showed a part of history few knew about . Great musical score , haunting melodies .
13734|5|This was one of my favorite movies . I'm not all that into war , but this movie really helped me out a lot . It showed me that afro-americans really made a difference in the world , even though it took us a long time . I would love to have been back then , only to fight and prove a point to myself and others .
13736|5|Matthew Broderick and Morgan Freeman , as well as Denzel Washington are great . The Civil War is shown in all it's unglamorous horror . Way better than The Patriot because it deals with history , has a moral and is realistic .
13738|5|This was a very moving movie and brought to life interesting aspects of the Civil War .
13739|5|One of my favorite movies . Glory is the story of Robert Gould Shaw - the white commander of one of the first battallions of black soldiers in the Civil War . The book which the movie was based upon was written by piecing together letters which Shaw sent back to his New England family - and which are still on display in a Boston museum . The acting is superb - Morgan Freeman , Denzel Washington , Matthew Broderick , the story is compelling ( and true ) , and the drama is intense . If you have not seen this movie , brace yourself - it is sad and powerful and deep and historical .
 1374|5|Great movie - soundtrack was terrific . A little bit of extraneous graphic violence could make some people squeamish , but you can close your eyes for a minute and not miss anything .
13740|5|The first war film I've ever seen . It was exciting . This was this first movie at which my eyes actually started watering .
13742|5|Easily one of my favorite movies of all time , Glory paints a wonderful portrait of the profound sacrifices Americans of all backgrounds made for fundamental liberties during the Civil War .
13743|5|I love this movie . . . almost made me cry . . . I'm a sap . . .
13745|5|This has got to be one of the best movies ever made . Tom Hanks , as always , is brilliant in this movie . Has a great suspension of disbelief . You know this couldn't be a true story , but you wish so much that it was , and believe every single thing that happens on it . This is deffinetly in my top five list of movies I've seen .
13746|5|Awesome movie ; acting was great !
13747|5|This was a really great movie and it really suprised me as I did not know what to expect . It is just a really good story and the acting was fantastic . The production was right on , giving that the depression era look . How can you not like this movie it is Tom Hanks at his best .
 1375|5|Arnold is a big time bad ass and this is a good movie .
13750|5|Another great Tom Hanks film . This film verified how I feel about the death penalty . I read the book too and found the movie to be fairly good at covering the book . The characters were believable and well rounded . I felt like I knew them .
13751|5|It was a powerful book and an equally powerful film . I thought David Morse was especially good in his role . This movie nearly changed the way I look at the death penalty and death row in this country . My favorite scene is when John is watching the movie of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers , and tears are streaming down his face . Michael Clarke Duncan gave a very powerful performance .
13756|5|A great movie . Great acting and visuals . I really enjoyed the story of John ; a simple man with extraordinary gifts . It kept me interested until the end . Seeing Percy get his in the end was a relief for me .
13759|5|Yet another great movie made from a Stephen King novel . Ever notice how many Tom Hanks movies are in the top 20 for this site ?
13760|5|The Green Mile is a movie that I probably will never fully forget , because it succeeded in not only grabbing my attention but also grabbing my emotions . I laughed and I cried during this movie , and watching it was worth every minute . The plot was solid , and the acting was supurb . Props to Michael Clarke Duncan for his phenominal performance as John Coffey , an African American falsely accused of killing two young girls and awaiting execution . We discover that he has the ability to heal , and that he is truly God's Miracle . Also great performances as usual by Tom Hanks and James Cromwell . Highly reccomended !
13765|5|This was a spectactular movie and the cast was amazing . Even though it is over three hours long , I couldn't stop watching it . It has such a magical tone to it . And the music is almost eerie . The cast gave an unbelievable performance . Doug Hutchinson was amazing as Percy , the little a * * hole , and by the end of the movie you just had the urge to strangle him . Tom Hanks , as always , gives an astounding performance as Paul Edgecombe . Bonnie Hunt was very good , too , as Paul's wife . David Morse was great and I give him two thumbs up for pushing Percy around and nearly beating the crap out of him . Sam Rockwell was so hilarious as Wild Bill . Barry Pepper as the young gaurd on E block . Michael Jeter as the inmate who befriends a mouse . And , of course , Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey , accused of murder , but can give life with the touch of his hands . I loved this movie . The good and the evil in these men of E Block was brought out in a marvelous way . If you loved the movie , read the book .
13767|5|Really really good movie . . . read the book . . . just as good if not better
13768|5|This movie is outstanding , not just for it's fine acting and interesting plot , but for it's ability to make the viewer think long and hard about the place the death penalty has in this so-called civilised society of ours . I would rate this movie as one of the best I have ever seen , and have watched it twice since I first saw it 3 months ago . A must-see for any adult who likes depth behind their entertainment .
 1377|5|i love this thriller it is entertaining and it would be better if jamie took her top off . her body can kill man .
13770|5|This was the saddest movie I have ever seen . I couldn't stop crying ! I couldn't even get through the end of it , I had to turn it off . Titanic was nothing compared to this !
13771|5|Wow . What a good movie . Didn't you just love the way Tom Hanks managed to make the character seem so real ? Gee , I can't see him enough . MORE TOM HANKS ! ! ! ! ! Aaahhh ! Ok , back to the movie . I loved the ending , loved the plot , the theme , everything about it ! I'm looking forward to reading the book . . .
13774|5|This is one of the best movies i've ever seen but it's a total tear-jerker and in the end you find that it moves you inside a lot .
13775|5|This was an amazing movie ! I don't see how neone could say this wasn't GREAT ! It kept me mesmerized throughout the entire thing .
13777|5|I think that this movie is a must-see ! It has like comedy and like sad stuff at the same time . to me i couldnt watch this movie again but it was awesome the first time . I dont know how to rate this , i guess u have to see it yourself , because its hard to rate it without like ruining suprises .
13778|5|This movie made me think about my career in law-enforcement . I was wanting to work in a prison but I have changed my mind . If I had to see or even here about someone being exicuted . So I think I will probably be a normal police officer now .
13779|5|Can I just say this movie was incredible . I didnt even notice the hours going by because it hooked me at the beginning and transported me into the world of Paul Edgecomb and the rest of the guards and the prisoners . The ensemble of great actors is what really made this movie spectacular . David Morse and Doug Hutchison top the list . They were both incredible . Doug played a sniveling little rat to a T . Such a moving powerful story . And so sad . All the actors did their parts so well , you really felt what the characters were feeling . I have watched it again and again . I never tire of it .
13780|5|Definately worth the three hours . . . sparking every emotion within a person . Cast is awesome , acting is great and storyline is excellent . Three months later we still talk about John Coffee .
13783|5|This has to be one of the top movies of the year . The movies will draw you in and extract every emotion you possess . The characters are well defined early in the picture and the story just leads you along . I couldn't find a weak link in the cast or the story . This is a must see .
13784|5|The green mile was a wonderful movie ! One never knows what life comes your way , make the best of everything you do in life and ? ?
13785|5|How this movie did not win the Oscar for best film is ridiculous ! I was moved to tears many times .
13788|5|Another fantastic adaptation of Stephen King's masterpiece .
13790|5|The Green Mile is a wonderful story that will make you believe in miracles and despise the dregs of our society . I totally fell in love with the characters and had to get out my Kleenex a few times . This is a great film and has wonderful performances by all the actors .
13791|5|I thought this movie was great ! It was different . It was a little slow throughout the first hour , but after that I was fully engaged .
13792|5|I thought this movie was great . I liked the whole movie . I didn't fall asleep once .
13794|5|This was a superb movie . The chemistry of the cast just added to the excellence of the film . I would highly recommend it . The character study alone is worth the price of the movie .
13797|5|This is an outstanding movie , with an exceptionally well assembled cast . The talented actors bring depth to the characters ( I may never stand at a urinal the same again ) . The visualization of the shamanic tradition played out in the movie is exceptional ; anyone who has studied shamanism in any tradition will immediately recognize the sucking shaman in John . It's a three hour movie that actually keeps you interested and stimulated the whole time ; You actually care what happens , and want to see someone kick the crap out of Percy . A definite must see . . . heck , I'm buying a copy !
13798|5|A great movie with very good acting . It causes one to wonder what it is really trying to say , but movies like that are always good .
13799|5|It was a long movie but incredible . It was one this years best . Great cast .
  138|5|It was a tall order , but Ted Levine ( Buffalo Bill ) steals the show from Hopkins and Foster .
13800|5|I enjoyed the acting and the directing of this movie . Also the spirituality content was phenomenal .
13801|5|Great film . Very long , and very emotional . Good actors , and Tom Hanks is at his prime .
13803|5|Tom Hanks has a great hit on his hands . Despite it's length , Green Mile holds the viewer's attention throughout the whole movie . Movie goers would not want to miss this one .
13807|5|Excellent movie . I liked this movie a lot , I would watch it again . Good story line . I would recommend this movie to everyone . After watching this movie , I was amazed by the story that I kept talking about it for hours and hours after . It made me cry a lot .
13809|5|I didn't expect to like this one , but wound up being very moved and entertained throughout all three hours . Highly recommended . . .
 1381|5|With an all-star cast , this film definately delivered . I always enjoy watching this film- a great mix of action and coemdy . Tom Arnold and Arnold Schwarzenneger had a very unique chemistry , and I thought that Tom Arnold did a wonderful job as the wisecracking annoying sidekick . I espescially like his line at the end : I'm sick of sitting in the van . . . . . Jamie Lee Curtis also gave a great performance as Schwarzenegger's clueless , naiive , shy wife . I love the way she makes the transition from good little housewife to bad girl in her notorious dance scene . That scene was both hilarious and sexy . I reccomend this film to anyone who is a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis or Schwarzenneger , or if you're just looking for a funny as hell action flick .
13814|5|Well worth the three hours . I'd see it again !
13815|5|A terrific movie . You won't feel the 3-hours playing time . Highly recommended !
13816|5|Definately an option for picture of the year . It was similar to Shawshank , but great in its own right . Not much action except when Tom Hanks and the other guards beat up the one sadistic guard .
13818|5|GREAT movie ! Tom Hanks gave an excellent performance ( as always ) . The movie captured every essence of the book . . moving , humorous , definitely makes you think . If it didn't bring a tear to your eye , you must be made of stone !
13819|5|Onem of the best movies ever . I loved it . Great acting , great story , lots of surprises .
 1382|5|What an action movie should be . Quite long but you always want to know what happens next so it is okay . Exactly the right amount of comedy , plenty of action and Tom Arnold was brilliant as the annoying sidekick to Arnie .
13820|5|This is easily the best movie of the year . Tom Hanks turns in another fantastic performance , supported by an amazing ensemble cast . The air of magic and faith makes every moment of this three hour movie intriguing and believable .
13822|5|Most people will think it is too long to take the time to sit down and watch it , but it they do they will realize it was well worth it . The russian ruloutte scene is very intense and well acted , due to the fact that DeNiro is one of the greatest actors of all time and because the Vietnamese portrayed actors were told to really hit DeNiro .
13823|5|The best movie I've ever seen , hands down
13824|5|This is without question one of the most poetic and heart breaking movies ever made . It is beautiflly written , directed and photographed and it has one of the best casts ever assembled for ANY movie . Oh yeah and there is Stanley Myers breathtaking theme cavatina playing throughout . In short this is one movie you should watch before you die ! ! ! !
13825|5|i love christopher walken and robert deniro . Deer Hunter is long but its a very good movie .
13828|5|This was the first movie that really took on the emotional experiences of our Vietnam veterens in a realistic way . The before and after scenes made a strong point in how this war affected those people . The difference between this war and other before it was that these veterens were not treated as heroes , and that , in turn , affected how they were able to handle life after the war . I don't think people understood what went on there until they saw this movie .
13829|5|Very twisted and smart . kind of long . must be very pacient
13834|5|This is one of those movies I will watch over and over . Such a great story of the value of human life and friendship . . the cast was so perfect for the characters . The way Kathy Bates' character developed from a unself confident doormat into a person who learned to make her own happieness was fun to see . And I think we all know an Izzy out there somewhere !
13835|5|its a wonderful movie where kathy bates meets this old lady in a nursing home that begins to tell her a story and after bates continues to return as she herself grows as a person
13838|5|One of my favorite movies . Based on the book by Fannie Flagg , this heart-warming story tells a tale of a forbidden love , murder , compassion , caring and redempion in the South during the early part of the 20th century . Told in narrative by an elderly nursing home resident ( played brillianty by Jessica Tandy ( but , then again , have you ever seen her act anything but brilliantly ? ) ) , the story not only gives you hope , but you can actually see it caried out on the screen by Kathy Bates ( also in a brilliant role ! ) as she listens and befriends the elderly lady . This movie is best watched while actually eating some of the title's namesak FRIED GREEEN TOMATOES . And remember , THE SECRET IS IN THE SAUCE ! ! !
13840|5|I really enjoyed this movie . I thought the teaming of Bates and Tandy worked great . I live a few miles from the Whistle Stop cafe and it is such a quaint place to go . It is like going back in time , and looks just like it did in the movie . No matter what you order you will get a fried green tomatoe on your plate . The food is very good and their fried green tomatoes are great .
13841|5|I think this is a very good movie . It has really superb acting by all the main people , and it has a good look to it . But the script takes a few liberties that I disagree with , and there a some flat out mistakes in it . I would still recommend the movie though , because if you haven't seen it as many times as I have ( too many to count ) you won't notice any of the mistakes , and it is very entertaining . However , I reccommend reading the book , too , because that is the best version of the story .
13843|5|Great movie ! ! I loved Kathy Bates character . Part of the film was done on location just ten miles from here . Our small part is a source of pride in this area .
13844|5|Fried Green Tomatoes , the quintessential chick flick , is a fantastic movie . The show alternates between two stories of women's friendship- one taking place in the present and the other set 50 years earlier in the small southern town of Whistle Stop . Kathy Bates ( as a dowdy , unenlightened housewife ) and Jessica Tandy ( playing an octogenarian living in a nursing home ) are a great pair , and they deserve credit for most of the movie's humor . The more serious side is shown through the relationship between Idgie ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) and Ruth ( Mary-Louise Parker ) who deal with a string of serious problems at a time when women didn't have many options . The acting is outstanding across the board , and the two storylines are engrossing . Even if you aren't a chick , I recommend checking out this movie .
13847|5|This movie really amazed me . When first I saw it , I went back and saw it again . Oh , the acting was amazing . That Kathy Bates . Where has she gone ? We miss you . Come back , Kathy Bates . Anyway , this movie certainly deserves the 5 star rating I have given it .
13848|5|Even after 24 years , still the greatest NYC , sports , psychopath , family redemption film ever . Will not be topped in our lifetimes .
13849|5|A brilliantly written , beautifully filmed nasty story about a largely despicable man . Not easy to watch , because it is hard to find someone to like , but it is a provoking , intelligent film .
13852|5|maybe the best sports movie ever , and shooting it in B / W added to the darkness and sinister power of the story .
13853|5|Wow ! Directed by Martin Sorsese who has a long working relationship with Robert De Niro and mainly shot in black and white . Its basically the life story of Jake LaMotta's life in regards to boxing and his relationships . The fight scenes in this are magnificent and I don't know how people can rate Rocky as better than this . This film doesn't sensationalise Jake's life , it shows him hitting his young wife , lashing out at his brother , being jealous of other men looking at his wife and him putting on weight . The storyline is as intense as the fighting scenes . I'm not a fan of boxing , but I'll happily sit down and watch this movie .
13855|5|A true modern classic . The slow motion fight scenes are , indeed , realistic and bloody . De Niro is amazing in this movie about LaMotta . There are adrenalin rushes aplenty thanks to Martin Scorcese's fine work .
13857|5|Truly Martin Scorsese's masterpiece and a candidate for the greatest film of all-time !
13859|5|Palpable pathos . Scorcese does a great job of setting up LaMotta ! Subsequent fall in the opening night club scene . Cinematography is gorgeous .
13860|5|Scorcese's greatest film . It is simply one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen , and has an uncommon power .
13862|5|DeNiro's best . Why is Rocky rated higher than this wonderful movie ?
13863|5|This movie is by far the greatest movie of the 1980s if not all times . It's so realistic , you feel as though you are a fly on the wall experiencing everything as Jake does . Robert De Niro gives his very best performance of his career ! It documents the rise to glory and the violent cascade down .
13865|5|One of the top sports-related movies ever made . DeNiro's performance is phenomenal . This movie paved the way for a host of copycats , none of which equalled the original . This movie is dark , intense and powerful , so if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy , this is not the right movie to rent .
13867|5|ADRIAN !
13868|5|One of the best sports movies ever made . This movie almost didn't get made . It was written by at that time and unknown ( Sylvester Stallone ) and acted by largely a cast of unknowns as well and shot on a very low budget . It was also the first movie to use the steadycam . Yet it won best picture at the 1976 Oscars overcoming all odds . . just like Rocky did in the movie . I can totally relate to the character of Rocky , a man so down in life and nobody gives him a chance they look down on him . It's just a movie about overcoming obstacles in life . . and even if you don't succeed completely , atleast you went all the way .
13873|5|I'm so glad to see so many positive reviews for Rocky . This is my favorite boxing movie of all time . In January or February of 1976 I was a young boxer training at the Main Street Gym , in Los Angeles , California , when I got a call from my manager / trainer , Mel Epstein , telling me that they were filming a movie about the life of Rocky Marciano at the gym . He asked if I would like to be an extra in the movie . Well , of course I said yes . Well as it turns out , they were not making a Marciano Bio . As the filming got under way , I had a chance to meet Sylvester Stallone , at that time I was not very impressed , since the only other time I had ever seen him was in The Lords of Flatbush . He was not yet the superstar he would later become . Infact he was really an unknown . He was , however a very nice guy . I got a picture with him and I've since had it blown up into an 8 X 10 , it's my pride and joy of a long ago time . In case anybody is interested , the scene that I'm in is when Rocky and Mickey are argueing after his gear was removed from his locker and hung on skid row . I'm in the upper right hand corner , in the ring that's on the right of the screen . I'm sparring with Monroe Brooks , who was the California State champ at the time , and a very nice guy , by the way . I'm wearing an off white or tan colored trunks and head gear . Actually these were my Navy Swim trunks . Brooks , I believe , was wearing red trunks . Not that it matters but just for identification only , he's the black guy . ( I hate doing that ) . Burgess Meredith had lunch with Mel ( my trainer ) and picked his brain for his Mickey character . They filmed at the gym for three days , and I got paid forty dollars a day . I would have done it for free . I was glad to see the movie get an Oscar , and was dissapointed that Stallone did not get the best actor award . It's funny but my kids always tease me , they know I like showing the movie and the picture , whenever someone is over for the first time . I've tried to stop because I think it embaresses them . Rocky was a classic story about an underdog who gets his shot at respect . For all these reasons , Rocky is one of my favorite movies , definetly my favorite boxing movie .
13874|5|it was the best boxing movie ever !
13878|5|I have seen all the rocky films hundreds of times and i still dont get bored watching them it's very hard to say witch rocky is the best many people find the 5th one to be quite crap but that might just be cause there was to many of them i'm sure that if that was the 2nd or 3rd rocky film people wouldnt find it crap . what better story could you ask for but a no name guy to world icon because he went the distance with the champ . when stallone made the film he had got the idea from a Muhammad Ali fight ( i cant rember who it was ali fought ) but he was inspired because that Ali's apponent was taking so much of a beating and he keep cumming back to fight and avetually knocked the champ down . stallone went home and for three days strait wrote the entier rocky script he even rote the fighting manovers they where going to use . i have heard there's a 6th one comming out i hope it dose aswell as the others .
13879|5|The Rocky series are my favourite films ever for so many reasons , the acting , the fighting and everything else is all brill ! The Rocky series also brought hope to the little guy in which they never get a chance ( or in Rockys case never got a shot at a decent title ) My favourite line of the whole film has to be in RockyIV where Apollo ( just b4 his fight ) says i feel like i could eat nails , Stallion ! Rocky replies I'v seen them snails in the garden but i'v never wanted to eat them Every time i see that clip i always laugh . After watching every film roughly 30times i still dont know my favourite . Thats how good these films are . I heard a rumour that a RockyVI is on the cards in which Rocky steps back into the ring 1 more time but we all no when Rocky says just one more fight he really means just another 20 . Hope the rumour is true . ROCKY ! ROCKY ! ROCKY ! ROCKY !
13880|5|Best Movies I've ever seen ! ! !
13881|5|Great
13883|5|All of the Rocky Movies were great , I especially liked the 3 one . The are great .
13884|5|Everyone loves the Italian Stallion . It is a great story of how the underdog can rise up and become the champion of the world , even beating Mr . T and the Russian .
13885|5|this is one of those movies I did not want to see but was glad I did . A young man named Rocky who is a boxer . Is chosen to play against Apollo Creed a professional boxer . I loved the fact that this was a movie about the underdog . Sylvester Stallone was very good as Rocky and he wisely showed the human side of Rocky . With his dertimination to work out to be a good boxer . Hs crush on a woman and his dating her . I found myelf realing caring about this character and rooting for him . a very well done movie .
13886|5|A simple guy with simple goals but who conquered the world . . . who couldn't like a movie like that whether it's sports or something else ?
13887|5|This was a good movie . I like boxing movies and this is my favorite one . I am also a big fan of Sylvester Stallone .
13888|5|Gotta see it . It is old but very cool .
13889|5|Great all time classic . Full of action . It is a bit cheesy to think of Rocky making it , but it gives everyone the feeling of hope for doing and becoming their dreams .
13890|5|This is one of my favorite movies . I loved the storyline . The fighting is also good . This movie really shaped American culture with the catch phrase Yo Adrian , and the tough guy image of Rocky .
13891|5|Great story of triumph and success . Even more amazing that Stallone wrote the screenplay . The best boxing movie I have ever seen .
13892|5|I still watch Rocky today , so you know it was good when it first came out . Rocky was the best because towards the end he always had style to him .
13893|5|It's great because it's about a super underdog who gets a break and takes advantage of it . He also gets the chick he wanted .
13894|5|Greatest boxing movie of all time . The script was originally written by Sylvester Stallone . It shows the outstanding triumph of the human spirit . Stallone had to actually train to box , making the movie that much more awesome .
13895|5|Rocky is a symbol of underpriviledged America rising up from the depths to overcome all odds and be a champion . Although Rocky doesn't win the fight , he truly is the victor . I've seen this movie over twenty times and I still love it .
13897|5|This was the ultimate American hero movie . It had an underdog , love and of course a wonderful ending where the underdog wins . Hurray Rocky !
  139|5|Smart ! Scary ! Great characterization ! Need I say more . . . I loved it !
13904|5|An American classic - Stallone was at his best .
13905|5|Rocky is a movie that can motivate even the most unmotivated person to succeed
13906|5|Rocky is my favorite movie b / c it gives me inspiration for life .
13908|5|This is a great movie , I believe this movie is Tom Cruise's best acting performance and Jack Nicholson does an amazing job . The exchange between these two at the end of the movie in the court room is probably the greatest scene in the history of moviedom . Great movie , one of the best I have seen .
13910|5|i love demi , think Jack is terrific , even Tom was good . . .
13913|5|This movie includes one of the great court scenes ever done in a movie . I'm can handle the truth : this movie was fantastic .
13914|5|What a captivating , compelling military drama which is nearly perfect in every department . A solid story and phenominal acting alone makes this film worth watching . Jack Nicholson gave his best performance ever in this film , delivering those famous lines : You can't handle the truth ! . His acting prior to and after saying that was just so intense and phenominal it makes me wonder why he didn't win the Oscar . Tom Cruise was also at the top of his game , and he was equally intense in the famous courtroom scene with Jack Nicholson . This truly is a drama that will thrill you and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish . Unmissable !
13915|5|A powerful look into corruption in the military and the debate between following orders v obeying your personal consience .
13916|5|Nicholson at his best . Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson playing a hardcore USMA Colonel heading up the base at Guantanamo Bay . Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise playing a cocky , young military defense attorney . Kiefer Sutherland as Nicholson's conniving Lieutenant portrays the slimeball accomplice perfectly , and Kevin Bacon as the JAGcorps DA gets that part to a tee . Combine all of that with splendid direction by Rob Reiner and you've got the best courtroom drama since Inherit the Wind . Oscars ? No . They don't give Oscars to movies that make you feel good about the military . But , after 9-11 , maybe they should reconsider .
13919|5|A must see
 1392|5|This movie kicked ass ! I have seen it like 50 times . It's sooo cheesy and predictable but it's totally cool and it's just really good and exciting , and Arnold is kinda' sexy and his wifey kicks ass . Good movie , everybody should see it .
13921|5|All I have to say is two names : Tom Cruise and Aaron Sorkin . Aaron Sorkin is the best director and writer I have seen in a long time . He finally got recognized in 2000 at the Emmy's for his talent . A Few Good Men has great looking guys and a believable plot as to what might happen to a weak member of a military squadron .
13922|5|Very entertaining . After I saw it I felt like going to law school .
13923|5|Jack Nicholson's has the greatest court speech ever . Intriguing story that keeps you glued to your seat . Interesting look into military life .
13924|5|Love the story . Intense . I can watch it over and over again . I love Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson .
13925|5|Great performances by high profile actors . Tom Cruise was fabulous as a lawyer , not to mention attractive . Fabulous , intracite plot that I could follow .
13927|5|One of the bests casts ever in a movie . Intensity and emotion came from this cast . Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise were great .
 1393|5|True Lies was a very good movie . It was full of action and excitement . From the first scene to the last , there was all kinds of action .
13930|5|The trial scenes are really intriguing , especially the final one . I don't like Tom Cruise being the lawyer though . He doesn't have the lawyer-kind-of face . I hate his acting too . Jack Nicholson does a great job ! !
13931|5|DEMI MOORE IN UNIFORM ( SIGH ) I THINK I'LL GO AND HAVE A LIE DOWN
13937|5|I wish this movie would have been hours longer . The story was compelling as was the love between them . I think that in our American history books we glorify people and gloss over reality in exchange for heroes . This movie showed what I believe was a much more accurate description of the average soldier , ignorant and narrow-minded . This movie was a masterpiece !
13941|5|I liked this movie because it showed American Indians as wonderful people , not savages . It showed how the American settlers took advantage of the poor Indians . Kevin Costner looked pretty hot in the movie .
13944|5|It's great because it shows how a man can change into something unexpected . He also gets the chick .
13945|5|This was a beautifully filmed movie . It presented a part of history rarely shown in film , which was great . The rich colors and landscape added so much to the film and how it was received . This film captures the essence of that time period .
13947|5|The drama movie Dances with Wolves was a very well directed movie . The story incorporated true history as well as fiction beautifully without making it boring . The story was heart-wrenching and the actors played their roles brilliantly .
13948|5|Great epic . Sad , melancholic , honest on the cruelty and stupidity of the American soldiers , the BS of war , non compassion . Good prevails .
13949|5|I don't care how much is incorrect , this was a great movie !
13951|5|A classic among American classics ! This frontier story was a masterful portrayal of frontier drama and emotion . One of Costner's best .
13953|5|An all time favorite . Scorsese's best ; De Niro's best . A classic .
13955|5|A groundbreaking powerhouse of a movie ! One of the finest acting performances of all time by De Niro and inspired direction by Scorsese . Disturbing but brilliant and deserves it's cult status . How did this not win any oscars ? De Niro still gives me goosebumps in the Boom , Boom scene . . .
13956|5|What the heck is everyone thinking ? This movie should be at the top .
13958|5|Another brilliant film from the '70s . DeNiro and Scorsese team up for the second time and have created a masterpiece on the subject of loneliness and despair . Foster is superb as the 14 yr old hooker that DeNiro saves as part of his redemption .
13959|5|It takes balls to make a movie like this and no one else could have pulled it off besides Martin Scorsese . There is a dark underworld to the human soul which id reflected by De Niro's character , Travis Bickle . I don't care how much anyone denies it , there is a Bickle in us all .
13961|5|De Niro kicks ass . One of his best roles . He's a complete lunatic nut .
13964|5|Illustrates how the anonymity of the city coupled with its sweetness can drive a person into feeling deep isolation . Taxi Driver points out a growing trend in society- people's need to be noticed . All people need to feel significant , however , some do it positively and some do it negatively . With a twist of irony , the end of Taxi Driver makes it clear that society is very distorted . They make this deranged taxi driver a hero , without knowing who he really is . We must be careful in choosing who to glorify .
13965|5|A man stands alone . . . He is an outsider . Unknown but shy and curious . He wants a friend but he can't . He can help but he doesn't understand . Do you want to push man further . . . let us take a slow ride through the life of the insane preacher !
13967|5|One of the best movies i have ever seen ! Robert DeNiro was fabulous at portraying this character whom you want to dislike but at the same time feel sorry for him . Great film !
13969|5|Taxi Driver is a great movie that portrays loneliness .
 1397|5|This movie rocked . Tia Carrere is fine . Arnold is really buff . The action was good , too .
13970|5|Matt Damon and Ben Affleck at their best ! This is one of the great movies of the late 90's .
13973|5|My all time favorite movie . It's the kind of movie that hits home on so many levels . I never get sick of watching it .
13974|5|MD is rad
13977|5|This film was simply brilliant . Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story when they were struggling young actors and wanted to break into the industry and they wrote a simple story set in their hometown of Boston and some of the main characters based on their Irish-American roots . People who accussed this story of being too simple overlooked what makes a great film which is the heart and soul of characters , a well written script and intelligent dialogue that seems to be lacking in many films today . That monologue that the Professor delivered to Will at the lake was one of the most gripping , moving and emotional speeches I've ever heard on film and that alone made this movie stand out .
 1398|5|Not only is it a thriller , but it's also for families . My younger siblings loved it . Great for families . Just enough action , comedy and love story . Almost a chick flick .
13985|5|A great movie that involves one man's struggle to cope with his own inability to pursue success due to personal insecurities of not only trust , but his own incapability to move forward in life .
13986|5|This is a fantastic movie . It's entertaining , intellectual , yet fun . It's easy to relate to and the characters are memorable . Robin Williams was great .
13988|5|Great movie . After watching it , I feel like studying .
 1399|5|True Lies was a good movie and it had nice killing all through the movie . Killing is good in movies . It makes it more real .
13994|5|This movie changed my life . I love everything about this movie : the writing , the acting , and the direction . Ben Affleck , Matt Damon , and Robin Williams gave outstanding performances . This movie about love , education , and the Boston life is one of the best .
13997|5|Well written script , where all characters were fully realized . The audience got to understand each character's motivations and desires and fears . Very interesting to watch the main character , Will Hunting , because he was so complex . He was violent and vulgar on the one hand , but a genius and funny on the other . This movie had a great message underlying : everyone should find their potential , we shouldn't waste our lives because we are only alive for a short time .
14002|5|This movie is about a genius who's stuck in a job going nowhere , and in a city going nowhere . He reads to learn and has the gift of understanding almost anything . He solves math problems that even math professors can't solve . He wins the girl that he wanted at the end .
14009|5|Matt Damon is HOT . He's great . I watned to be my best friend .
 1401|5|This movie was an original . The fact that Arnold was a secret agent and his wife didn't know about it made the movie hillarious , especially when they were on a mission together . I loved this movie and it was one of my favorites .
14011|5|This is a great movie and a wonderfully written screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck . Damon and Robin Williams are both excellent as the thug / genius and therapist , respectively . It also includes one of the greatest lines in recent movie history . HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES ! ! !
14013|5|I really enjoyed this movie . Matt Damon does a good job playing the tough guy , tormented , working class genius , while Robin Williams ( whom I'm not normally a big fan of ) is outstanding as the therapist who is only barely keeping it all together . The chemistry between Damon and Williams is why this movie works . With a good story line , excellent acting , and likeable characters - this movie is highly recommended .
14016|5|Incredibly powerful movie . Masterfully made . Robin Williams was at his best ( which is awesome ) , and this made me a fan of Matt Damon .
14019|5|I Loved that movie ! It was very emotional . Robin Williams is a great actor !
14020|5|this movie was just filled with talent . julia roberts as shelby was lovable . sally fields as maylynn shelbys mother was a great performance . darryl hannahs character was irritating . shirley maclaine and olympia dukakis were hilarious especially when they did scenes with each other . those 2 were my favorite . its funny its sad its happy all in one
14021|5|Very sad .
14023|5|A great movie ! I thought the whole cast was great . It is listed as a drama , but it had a number of hillarious scenes in the movie . I espcially loved the scene with Shelby's wedding and the red velvet cake shaped like an amarillo . AND IT IS NOT JUST A MOVIE FOR CHICKS ! This movie will make you laugh and cry , just a really good movie .
14029|5|This has to be the greatest movie ever made .
14030|5|One of my favorite dramas . It is the definition of stunning . Beautiful film .
14031|5|Classic . For some reason ( 'Can't put my finger on it ) , F . Murray Abraham as Salieri was phenominal .
14033|5|One of my favorite movies of all time !
14034|5|A favorite . No one's sure how accurate we can deem it but I certainly enjoyed the story and it helped me to appreciate Mozart more .
14037|5|This film tries and succeeds at adapting a play in which Mozart is hated by one of his contemporaries . Salieri's hatred of Mozart is never really developed well other than Mozart's arrogant slight of Salieri , but the movie does very well at chronicling the life of the composer and his relationship with both his wife and father . For anyone interested in this type of period work , it is a must see , not just for the dialogue and plot , but the music which really does make the movie .
14038|5|although i rate this as a great movie , i could never figure out why saleri hated mozart so much . . . time and again , the 'reason' is shown in the film , but saleri , although jealous , idolized mozart . a scene in particular is when mozarts wife , constanze , takes originals to saleri for his 'approval' to bring mozart into the royal court , as they are becoming penniless . . . he says the music is 'miracleous' , but drops the originals on the floor and steps upon them as he walks out , refusing to give mozart any sort of consideration , although throughout the entire movie , he constantly claims devotion to him . . . anyway , a great movie !
14040|5|This is one of the favorite movies of my youth . Even though it's a period film , it's really funny . The actor who played the main character did a great job .
14043|5|Amadeus is a great movie for its cinematic efforts ! This is a movie that tries to show the true lives of Mozart Amadeus for the sake of telling a true story , not just made to put actors in costume .
14045|5|If you enjoyed this movie , then you ought to read MOZART byWolfgang Hildesheimer . Mozart was a very twisted , perverted genius .
14046|5|Excellent film . Sure there are some inaccuracies in it but who cares it's entertainment and excellent entertainment at that . Very engaging , it really draws you in , F . Murray Abraham is absolutely transfixing in this film . He does an incredible job as the aged Saliery . His expressions , mannerisms , and speech is spot on . If you've missed this then you've really missed out .
14048|5|From its debut on the theatrical stage to its cinematic reproduction , the story of the worlds most renowned prodigy has found its place among the great stories of all time . The film portreal of mozart brings with it more than a great story though , including excelent acting and one thing that has remained unparalleled in movie making . The best soundtrack of all time .
14056|5|Aside from the useless profanity , this Ron Howard-directed classic combines great science , good acting and great special effects with an upbeat ending ! Highly recommended !
14058|5|OUTSTANDING ! ! ! ! Ron Howard really did his homework on this one . The story is well written and the actual facts are as damn close to the truth as possible in hollywood . The use of actual props and NASA footage made this movie a real look into history . I think the intent was to inform you more than entertain you , and this movie did bolth . To say this movie was boring , three guys floating around in a broken tin can shows the lack of inteligence in that particular viewer . The story of Apollo 13 is true , it happened , it is an important date in areospace history and this movie portraies it well
14061|5|Good film . It is an accurate and legendary recreation of the Apollo 13 incident . I highly reccomend this film . Brilliantly directed by Ron Howard . Tom Hanks has a career performance .
14064|5|A great learning tool about leadership styles
14065|5|This movie made my A list when I first saw it . It is one of the best protrayals of actual American history I have ever seen , and it really brings out some of the work necessary to bring about the greatest technological achievement of all time , and the amount of danger in which the astronauts could easily find themselves . When Tom Hanks made his series on the Apollo missions , his Apollo thirteen episode concentrates on aspects separate from those portrayed in this movie , which allows this movie to become a working part of the series . The work of Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise brings out some of the greatness of this film , while Tom Hanks easily portrays the pain of aborting a lunar landing . If you haven't seen it , you should . Anyone even vaguely interested in space will be impressed .
14068|5|Tom Hanks , Gary Sinease , and Kevin Bacon all portray the astronauts of Apollo 13 remarkably . The musical score is very beautiful . The movie is heartwarming yet suspenseful .
14069|5|Tom Hanks directed a winner . Very compelling and enjoyable to watch .
14071|5|One of the great moments in cinema history when Kevin plays catch with his dad- makes me cry like a baby every time I see it .
14073|5|A very well-done movie with a feel-good attitude through almost the entire film . Great performances from James Earl Jones and Kevin Costner don't hurt , along with the great scenery . Great ending as well !
14074|5|This is my all time favorite movie . Every minute of it was great , I didn't even mind his annoying hippie wife . Even Costner acted with a little personality , and Lioatta did a great job of playing Joe . Lancaster was great , everyone was . This story brought a tear to my eye more than once . I remember the first time I saw it on USA , I was moved like I never was moved before . Before I saw this , I didn't think I could be emotionally effected by movies . I was very , very wrong .
14077|5|W P Kinsella is an American treasure and this movie may actually be as good as his book ( titled Shoeless Joe ) . Costner and the always-excellent James Earl Jones shine like angels . If you like baseball movies , and I love them , this is a great film . If you don't like baseball moves , but like films about characters who persevere and follow their dreams , this is still a great film .
14078|5|wow , not just a baseball movie . I loved it for a variety of reasons , but I really think that 'baseball' was just a vehicle for the expression of sorrow , regret , and reconciliation between a father and a son . Watched it maybe a dozen times , the last 20 minutes always chokes me up . We all look at our parents differently when we get older . We usually get an opportunity to mend fences . Kevin Costner's character had no way to reconcile with his dad , except thru the field of dreams . James Earl Jones is great in a supporting role and provides many , many great quotes in the final scenes of the movie .
14081|5|I think this was the best and most beautiful baseball movie ever It had all the greats and made even people who didn't like baseball love the game !
14086|5|Eventhough I'm a 'chick' , I liked it very much .
14089|5|Show it , and I will come .
 1409|5|True Lies was very unexpectedly excellent . I don't like Arnold but I think he did an AWESOME job and Jamie lee Curtis , for an old woman she has a great body .
14096|5|As a closet Tim Burton fan , I was excited to see this film and while the odd pace of the movie slowed me down a bit , I wasn't disappointed . A visual extravaganza for the eyes , filled with fanciful sights and effects , it was delightful . The plot was fun and ambitious in its twists and turns . The always wonderful Ewan McGregor was charming and heart-warming . Billy Crudup also did a fantastic job . A darling movie that definitely be given a chance .
14107|5|First thing to get straight is that this is not meant to be some cak comedy but is an amusing satire on media power gone out of control . Carrey at lasts drops the gurning and turns in a decent performance here . On first viewing the film turns up some nice little surprises such as when he discovers his family isnt real . Much better than copycat films like Ed TV , this is an original and thought provoking movie .
 1411|5|The Redux version fills in some holes and makes more sense . Watch that version if you can .
14112|5|This is basically the only film where I can actually watch Jim Carrey - he's being an actor instead of a cartoon character and he pulls it off really well . The whole point of this film is to question just how much the media influences and controls us from day to day - to the extent that a media company adopts a baby and creates a false world for him and everyone in his life , friends , family and even his wife , are actors . It reflects how we get sucked into shows and believe the characters to be real . The plot is good with Truman realising that the world he is living in is false and he breaks free . This is a heartwarming film and definately teh best role of Jim Carey's career .
14113|5|Incredable preformance by Jim Carrey . Perhaps his first drama , this movie really makes you think about life . Could you be but just another Truman , in a world modified especially for you . I walked out of the theater pondering this stupid quetion . But , I have not yet found an answer . I forget the screenwriter's name at the moment , but what a marvelous idea he ( they ) had . Amazing story .
14114|5|It's amazing how they have sort of the Big Brother theme , where they are taping Truman's life into a 24 / 7 TV show . It was really an intriguing movie .
 1412|5|Maybe not the greatest , but has to be seen in 70mm widescreen and full stereophonic sound to really appreciate this film . In a large theatre with at least a 65 foot screen .
14123|5|Truman Show was funny . I liked it . I thought it was a comedy though . Jim Carrey did an excellent job in this movie . He is a wonderful actor .
14125|5|I thought Jim Carrey had a very sensitive and convincing role in this movie . It made me ask questions about myself like what I perceive as reality . The idea was original and well cast . I think Jim Carrey should have been nominated for an Oscar .
14128|5|Movie is not only funny , but justified . Violence and language kept to a minimum . True to life and doesn't have unnecessary stuff to pump ratings .
14134|5|I like the movie because it relates to my life and I did not think a movie could touch my heart the way this movie has .
14135|5|This show has something extra - it remains with you long after it's over , raising questions , bringing up new perspectives , etc . Jim Carrey was a good choice , but he didn't seem completewly restrained to me - there were a few over the top moments . These were balanced , though , by some incredibly good acting .
14138|5|Out of all the Jim Carrey movies I've seen , this is the best ! It's so real . . .
14140|5|I loved this movie ! Jim Carrey did a wonderful job . At first it was confusing , but after you wantch it a few times , it's easy to understand . I think it's one of the best movies that Jim Carrey has done !
14144|5|This film was very special for me ! I felt like it was me that had written the manus or maybe it was me that the movie was about ? The reason was that the topics of the film , like what if everyone knows what you're doing all the time ? etc . was thoughts I've had a lot of as a child ! One of the greatest movies at all time ! : o )
14145|5|hilary swank is awesome . IMO .
14146|5|I was dragged to this . . . I had my mind made up before I saw it- PC junk Boy was I wrong . A solid dramatic film based on real events . Hillary Swank ( who clearly has left her awful Karate Kid movie behind her ) was terrific and believeable . Good film . . . but unpleasant to watch the final violent sequence- be warned .
14148|5|An incredibly powerful and intense movie . It reminded me of American History X with the atmosphere and mood of the story and its setting . The characters are all wonderfully developed , and the movie is very interesting all the way through . Hillary Swank was Oscar-material with her amazing performance in this film . It is a very emotional TRUE story , and was well worth watching . Highly reccomended !
14149|5|I'm a bit late in coming in on this , but I count Boys Don't Cry as among one of my favorite films . It is raw , powerful , disturbing and heartwrenching . Hilary Swank was amazing and totally deserved the Oscar ! The supporting cast was great as well , from Chloe Sevigny as the just-as-confused lover of Brandon to Peter Sarsgaard as sociopathic killer John Lotter . The first time I saw it I wasn't too sure , but after watching it a few more times , I really got into the story . The fact I used to live just over an hour from where the real Teena Brandon was murdered ( I now live in Omaha ) hit close to home . Seeing the movie helped me become , well , obsessed with the real case . I've been to Falls City , I've seen the house Brandon was murdered in , I've been to her grave in Lincoln , it just blows your mind that something like this happened in America in 1993 ! The story is more along the lines of a racial lynching in the South in the 1920s , but it is real , it happened right under our noses in late 1993 as we were sitting in theaters , stunned and watching Schindler's List . Yes , this movie might be very uncomfortable for many to watch , but it's such an important film for the time we live in . If you can't handle it , then you must have a problem with reality . It's not freaky stuff that goes on in the film- Teena Brandon really DID dress as a man , DID date women and have sex with them , DID get her pants pulled down and she WAS raped and murdered for no good reason ! You can't make that kind of stuff up , folks . People just need to open their hearts and minds a little bit to realize there are still people in this country to this very day who are harassed , beaten and even killed because of who they are . Does the name Matthew Sheppard ring a bell with anyone ? He and Teena Brandon will go down in history as tragic martyrs of the gay / transsexual rights movement .
14155|5|I haven't seen it , but I want to . There's just a response I would like to make to ToddsternOhio . Are you sure you are a student of film and cinematography , or are you a narrowminded idiot ? ? ? ? ? I have never read so much crap that makes me feel angry . Did you know that the human body has male and female hormones , so if there was an imbalance , then that person would either be more feminine or masuline . And there have been many cases of where the person should have been born as the other sex . There are many people in this world who succeed dressing up as the opposite sex and getting away with it . Surely you watch the Jerry Springer Show - you get lots of cases of where a man decides to be a woman and has a boyfriend - and he doesn't know . In Japan , there are men who transform themselves into women who look very realistic . My sister gets mistaken for a young boy . So you were saying . . . . .
14161|5|it was really sad and it was kinda messed up too , but it was a great movie
14162|5|This story first appeared in Vanity Fair about two years ago , and at that time I was both saddened and intrigued at the life of Brandon Teena . The movie was very well done , the acting was excellent , and it touched upon a very relevent subjuect : the hatred and persecution of gay women .
14165|5|It is hard to rate this movie . There are so many disturbing things about 'Boys Don't Cry' that it makes it hard to say it is Great ! On the other hand , it is done so well , as disturbing as it is , I have no choice but to rate it a 5 . The story about a girl who is really a boy inside ( but born with girl parts ) goes to a new town , as a boy and discovers love with a young girl . The acting is amazing . I forgot that she was a he . The movie was put together in all aspects . The director did a great job .
14166|5|This movie kicks ass ! ! ! You have to see it . However , remember that it is VERY intence .
14170|5|The movie follows the book fairly well . While depressing from the beginning until the very end , the movie shows a slice of life that is very real for some . I think the movie shows the pain experienced by todays youth whether it's related to sexual identity or acceptance and belonging in general .
14171|5|I saw Boys Don't Cry on campus and I really liked the movie . The topic was fresh and the acting was very convincing . I thought that it did not try to sugarcoat what is obviously a very emotional topic , and this made Boys Don't Cry , stick in my mind as a powerful movie .
14173|5|This movie is superb . Hillary Swank was incredible . She is a wonderful actress . The movie was poignant and heavy . The fact that it was real made the movie more intense . It's a downer , but worth watching it !
14175|5|I've never seen a real-life movie that was this good . It presented a controversial topic in a way that can open people's minds . The acting was great . Hilary Swank deserved her award for the portrayal of Brandon .
14177|5|This movie should and will leave you sobbing . It takes you on an emotional roller coaster , from sublime to heartbreak . The tragedy is that the movie is true , and it's so sad when you realize people can be so cruel . ( More conservative people might not enjoy this flick , but I suggest they see it anyway . It might open their eyes . )
 1418|5|I've only seen the redux , but since they added a nude scene I don't mind . Lots of carnage , lots of surealism , and Kilgore was hilarious .
14183|5|Hillary Swank did a remarkable job at portraying Brandon Teena . An Oscar well deserved !
14184|5|This movie is well worth the price of admission . Hilary Swank gives a stellar and convincing portrayal of Brandon Tina . I highly recommend this movie to everyone . Keep in mind it is a bit disturbing .
14186|5|Boys don't cry is an awesome film , with great cast , especially Hilary Swank as Brandon Teena , she ia absolutley amazing , that's why she won the Golden Globe for best actress and probably the Oscar , I hope so . Go see it .
14187|5|Hilary Swank's performance as Brandon Teena was phenomenal . There is an Oscar Award is this young woman's future ! !
 1419|5|I was a little cynical about seeing this because of the mixed reviews I'd received of it . Now I only wonder who could dislike it . One critic described it as one of the two most powerful films of all time , right up there with The Godfather . Well , this guy pretty much hit the nail on the head . By the end of this movie , I was unable to get up from my seat , and I still had the word horror playing in my head for about three more hours . Colenol Kurtz is an outstanding representation of every single aspect of the hell of the Vietnam War . The scenes of walking through the island near Cambodia with bodies everywhere and heads scattered all over the ground were to say the least , shocking . What's worse is that things like this probably happened . Take care , everyone !
14191|5|An excellent movie . It has it all- mystery , action , political intrigue and sex . Fabulous costumes and scenery , lush cinematography . This movie was gyped of its Oscars by Shakespeare In Love .
14192|5|Beautiful costumes and great casting . Brings forth Queen Elizabeth in a whole new light that attracts young people .
14193|5|This movie gives insight to a woman's life that is a major part of history . Until I saw this movie I did not realize what kind of life she went through . I am glad that the storyline wasn't changed too drastically from the actual historical events .
14195|5|I thought this was a good movie . I didn't think I'd like it at first . Elizabeth led an interesting life and I learned a little bit about her as well as being entertained .
14196|5|Cate Blanchett was superb as Elizabeth , she deserved the oscar . A brilliant portrayl of the Virgin Queen . I believe that it matters very little that there may be small historical innacuracies in the movie , for 'Elizabeth' inspires the watcher the learn more about Elizabeth I for themselves .
14197|5|Now this was a very well-done historical film ; Kate Blanchett's steely white face without a doubt will flicker before my eyes everytime I read British history . Both accurate and intriguing , history came to life in all its costumes and turning an otherwise dull chapter of monarchy into a magnificent saga of sacrificial triumph . Elizabeth the Queen feminist-whoever would have thought .
  142|5|Put the God Damn dog in the bucket ! That creepy cross dressing naked pee pee hiding man still enters my nightmares once in a while . I think this is the most frightening psychological thriller I have ever seen . Strangely , I started to like Hannibal and the demented relationship that he was creating with Agent Starling . I may be sick . But this is a classic that you can watch over again and still be freaked out .
 1420|5|There are many great war films out there , but Apocalypse Now is certainly the greatest of them all . Although , technically not a war film , it deals with thoughts and ideas that could only be conjurred in the act of war , thus I classify it as such . This film showcases Francis Ford Coppola's director skills , even more so than his Godfather films ( although that is endlessly arguable ) .
14201|5|Absolutely positively the best period piece ever ! Best love won lost ! Best inspiration for women wishing to kick butt in a man's world .
14202|5|Two thumbs up ! ! One of the best movies ever ! ! I really really recommend everyone to watch this . I was very disappointed when it didn't get the Academy Award . I think this film deserves it . Cate Blanchett should've won the Best Actress too .
14203|5|Wonderful thought provoking film and [ thankfully ] no-one being blown up , chased . . . . not much action but much emotion
14208|5|Very touching movie with two old veterans , Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn . They are both hilarious and heartwarming as the aging couple who are spending another summer in their lake home . The relationship they have , as well as their relationships with their daughter , her fiance , and her soon to be stepson who gets stuck there with them , are all right on target and it all rings true . You can't help but laugh at Henry Fonda , even though he's spouting obscenities half the time .
14209|5|one of the greatest movies of all time , definitely !
14210|5|simply wonderful - not much action but charged emotion , seen it several times
14211|5|Great acting by great old actors . Great script .
14214|5|Russell Crowe can flat-out ACT . Jennifer Connelly gives an exceptionally fine performance as well .
14216|5|This movie was excellent . Very intriguing story of this mathematical genius with a profound life-debilitating illness . I was fascinated with how his delusions were made to seem so real . I know someone personally affected by schizophrenia and this movie opened my eyes a little more about how the victims lives are taken over by their imaginings . The movie truly touched me , I shed a tear . Russell Crowe is an excellent actor .
14221|5|An amazing and powerful movie . A moving depiction of schizophrenia . Well written and well acted . I could almost say that Russell Crowe is possibly the best actor working today .
14225|5|Without doubt one of the best movies i have ever ever seen . it ` s quite simply brilliant
14227|5|FANTASTIC ! ! This movie will be used in abnormal psych classes for years to come due to its remarkable portrayal of schizophrenia . This disorder is sorely misunderstood and this movie shows it is not just a skid row problem . Russell Crowe was flawless and Jennifer Connelly earned her Oscar ( although I thought her co-star in Requiem for a Dream had an equally compelling performance ) .
14234|5|If you want to understand mental illness , this is the movie to see .
14236|5|A very well done movie . This is based on the life of mathematician John Nash . Russell Crowe did a wonderful job portraying John Nash and his battle with schizophrenia . I really felt for John and the demons that he delt with his mental illness . I felt this movie showed a real brutal honesty about how hard it must be to deal with schizophrenia . Ron Howard won a much deserved oscar for his directing . I would recommend this movie . It is a bit too long though .
14237|5|great story based on true story
14244|5|I thought it was a great movie from the story to the acting to of course the directing . It kept my constant attention . It's the kind of movie you walk away from and can't stop thinking and talking about . My hubby's first words after it ended , It makes you feel like it's never too late to go out and accomplish whatever you want . It made us laugh , it made us cry , it made us feel . Wonderful performance by Russell Crowe , he really made it feel very real like you were right there going thru it all with him ( Mr . Nash ) .
14245|5|It's a great movie , and please do not read ellajedlicka's comment if you wish to see it with any element of surprise or suspense . I'll say it got my mind turning in areas of psychology , and made me excited about the potnetial of life .
14246|5|It is the true story of mathematics and economics genius John Nash and his terrible struggle with paranoid schizophrenia . He has delusions of a roommate at Princeton ( where he is attending graduate school ) and his niece as well as an F . B . I . agent that is supposedly making him a code-breaker to save the world from a nuclear attack in the early '50s . His mental illness is made apparent to him when a psychiatrist takes him to an asylum and gives him electric shocks to try to eradicate the delusions . He has a lifelong struggle and becomes a threat to others . He starts to teach at Princeton still is suffering . He wins a Nobel Prize in 1994 for an economic theory he materialized in the late '40s while he was attending graduate school . It really makes his delusions seem like real people so you can see what schizophrenic people really think is real and their inability to discern reality from imagination . It is a very touching movie as well as a little sad to see this guy suffer so much .
14247|5|No Oscar marterial , but an intriguing film with a few good lessons to be learned . Russell Crowe's characters' schizophrenia had sort of a double meaning . . . he saw the world diferently than others did . Sort of like I noticed that everyone seemed to have blue eyes , and everyone else thought I was insane . . . guess I'm the only one who noticed it . This was probably one of the best movies I've seen all year ( up there with Life As A House ) and if the directors don't WAKE UP and start making a couple of REALLY good films , it may end up winning and deserving most of the awards . Overall , a pretty good Ron Howard job with outstanding acting by Russell Crowe Co . Take care , everyone !
14249|5|Tom Hanks got an oscar but Denzel should have gotten one too . He was awesome as he learned about human compassion and learned to throw bitotry out the window . This movie was moving and compelling and told a necessary story aobut the treatment of people with this horrible disease .
14254|5|A classic court drama , and Tom Hanks was perfect .
14255|5|Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington were great . This really has to open people's eyes to what its like to live with something as stigmatizing as AIDS . This should be mandatory for all people to watch .
14258|5|This movie sets an example all families should follow if their son , brother , etc . comes out to them . I was touched by their acceptance and it pains me when I hear from other gay men I know how they have been shunned by their family . I was immensely touched by this movie as many others were .
14259|5|An emotional , moving film with a superb performance by Tom Hanks as a gay lawyer with AIDS . I loved the way that the movie brought rebuke and scorn to the ignorant homophobics and the damage they can cause to the emotional systems of homosexuals ( and some heterosexuals ) . Throughout the entire movie , I was rooting for Tom Hanks' character to win the fight . A must-see film for everyone , especially the homophobics ; a good deal of them need to realize that what they do and say to gays is a mental stab in the back . I can see why Tom Hanks won an Oscar for his performance . . . one of my all-time favorite movies . Take care , everyone !
 1426|5|Talk about a trip through Hell ! Apocalypse Now is both real and surreal and most definitely devastating . This movie captured the overall mood of the Viet Nam era with all its emotional turmoil , political insanity and feeling of emptiness more completely than any other film I have ever seen . I saw it when it was first released and sat there wondering for awhile why the theater seemed so odd . Then it suddenly occurred to me as I was leaving that nobody in the place had moved , spoken or even gone to the bathroom for the last hour of the show .
14261|5|A brilliant and beautiful film , with sympathetic characters and lovely moments - the opera scene and the final scenes representing Hollywood at its best and most powerful emotionally .
14262|5|An incredible movie that came at a time when we needed it most . Tom Hanks is moving and quite amazing as the lawyer afflicted with AIDS and Denzel Washington becomes the homophobic lawyer who takes on the case . Not only does Philadelphia explore the professional prejudice against AIDS victims , it brings us into the personal world . . the human side . A very touching movie and sometimes difficult to watch . I specifically remember the scene after the costume party ( Washington is trying to discuss the case as Hanks sings and translates the aria ) An effective scene . If I have to explain that , it was lost on you . A must see .
14269|5|A nihilistic descent into schizophrenic madness that I can't stop watching . Maybe it's the intricate photographic work , maybe it's Fincher's ear for dialogue , maybe it's the spellbinding performances by Ed Norton , Helena Bonham Carter , Meatloaf , and Brad Pitt , maybe it's all of the aforementioned . . . . . it's an obsessive relationship that I never want to end . From the opening " needle drag " and Dust Brothers intro , you're swept into the dreary dirge of Norton's anticipated existence ( recounted through jarring skips and flashbacks ) , never suspecting the ease with which he ends up dealing with his insomnia-induced repression . Shot through with trenchant humor , jabs at popular culture , and gnarly twists throughout , you'll find yourself enjoying it a little more than you should . A few " squirm and shifts " from time to time ( and his name is Robert Paulson ) , but with a title like " Fight Club " , you shouldn't expect shortbread at high tea . Get the disc and see for yourself why this film instills such ardor among its legion of loyal and eager fans .
14271|5|A very good movie . The first time I watched it I didn't get it . I watched it again and listened to an interview of Ed Norton , and Brad Pitt , then I began to get it . Since then I've probably watched it two or 3 more times and pick up more and more each time . It's a brilliant film . How I didn't see it from the beginning I don't know . The twists and turns this movie take . It really makes you pay attention and think , it's not a movie that you can flip back and forth to or watch while you're doing something else . Ed Norton-a fantastic actor . Brad Pitt-more than just a pretty face . I like to watch this when I'm alone so there are no distractions .
14273|5|great acting
14274|5|my favorite movie ever
14275|5|Brad Pitt and Edward Norton shine in this cutting edge drama . The whole movie is thrilling and humerous . I was on the edge of my seat ( couch ) the whole entire movie . WOW ! ! ! One of my favorite films of all time . No doubt about it .
14278|5|what do you think
14279|5|A cutting edge movie , through and through . Norton does another great job ( I only knew him from Rounders ) and somehow complements Pitt pretty well . The camera work was fascinating and original .
 1428|5|A brilliant film ! Coppola's adaptation of Conrad's novel is beautiful . Apocalypse Now is cinematically excellent , and beautifully preformed . Martin Sheen is so convincing in that role , his lack of recognition for it is a crime .
14281|5|The greatest movie ever made .
14283|5|Hands down the best socially influential movie since Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs and the best ( and probably only good ) Brad Pitt movie . This is my bible .
14284|5|Its my fav . movie ever . If you havent seen this movie go buy it ! now ! Its not about fighting If you cant appreciate this movie for what it really means I feel bad for you . I wish I could give it 10 stars
14285|5|Awesome movie ! Inspires lots of philosophical conversations .
14289|5|it was ironic and very strange , I had no clue what was going on untill the end , very confusing but if you think about it , the story's very good . bizzare ending , who would've known ? good film
14292|5|My 5th favorite movie of all time .
14295|5|Definantly a five star movie . Its almost scary of how real the acting was . You really dont get all the sub messages that this movie gives off unless you see it about four times . Unless your some movie badass and can name every little twist this thing shows . If you want to see a movie that will get you thinking , than this is your movie .
14296|5|What an amazing movie ! ! ! ! ! Haven't seen one that good in a long time . I really admire Edward Norton's work . He's one talented actor ! Brad Pitt was at his best . I just loved the end . I'm an optimist when it comes to judging movies . . .
 1430|5|This movie is an outright classic . Never has a Vietnam epic been depicted in such a psychotic , yet moving fashion . Apocalypse Now never gives you a moment to relax and just stare at the screen . You will constantly find yourself questioning the sanity of the characters and yourself . A definite must see .
14301|5|I felt I had to rate this film to point out an error a lot of people seem to be making . The fighting that everyone is going mad about in the film , while being very accurate and thus nasty to watch , is also supposed to symbolise the inner turmoil going on within Edward Nortons charachter . The person who recommended people watch it but fast forward the fight scene's , is mis guiding people . The fight scenes are as important as the rest of the story , as they are supposed to give you an actualisation of his inner turmoil . Well , in my opinion , anyway . One more point- everyone seems to think that the main charachters name is Jack ( Nortons ) , but if you watch the film again , you will see he only adopts this name after reading an article in a magazine he found in the house he shares with tyler- something about Jack's Kidney or something- anyway the point is we never find out his name , as it's not considered important because all that happens is done by Tyler anyway . Opinionated- I am , Right- your call !
14303|5|I first saw this film when my partner brought back a pirate copy from Khazackstan for my 19th and I loved it . At the beginning I thought I was imagining things when an image of Brad Pitt is imposed onto a frame in the film about 3 times . Very clever , you can see the insominia is building up with the main character . It is a very intresting concept and acted out very well .
14305|5|Billiant acting . Awesome cinematography . Great storyline , original , funny , very smart . Cool score / soundtrack music . 10 / 10 , best movie i've ever seen , in my opinion .
14310|5|Exceptional . Very deep . Twisted . If you ever wanted to be virtually shashed by movie - go for it .
14313|5|Fight Club is the best movie ever created .
14316|5|I was not disappointed at all in Fight Club ! I went in not knowing anything about the film , and came out satisfied with the acting , the themes ( underlying and apparent ) as well as the twists . I think I am a rather observant person , however I was totally caught off guard with the twist of this movie . I thought it was a thought provoking and raw look into the life of this ordinary man .
14318|5|Someone will literally have to explain to me what is WRONG with this film . Nothing . Great acting , an intersenting ending , a message with a philosophy behind it , and Brad Pitt . It is one of the best I've seen this year .
14319|5|A strange , dark descent into nihilistic fantasy . Uneven , yes . . . and yet it's now one of my favourite movies .
14327|5|A very good film , a retired Jewish school teacher in the south with a black man that her son hired to drive her because she was to old to drive herself . It brought up bigotry , illiteracy , ageing , all kinds of issues but most in a pretty subtle fashion . The relationship between the driver , Morgan Fairchild and the teacher , Jessica Tandy changes throughout the movie .
14328|5|I loved this movie . It was funny and sad . I like a movie that makes you laugh and then brings tears . That is what real life is like .
14336|5|Excellent movie . I would recommend for all age groups . This movie shows how blacks were treated , not only in the past , but now as well . There are people who are mean and cruel and some who are respectful and humane . The movie has / had context and was enjoyed by all .
14339|5|Morgan Freeman is always wonderful . This academy award winner is full of humanity -- what a nice change of pace from so much of Hollywood . . .
14340|5|I think this movie is really cute and touching . The friendship between them was really beautiful .
14341|5|This is the most intense movie I have ever seen . Everything is great about this movie . The acting , the directing , and the cinematography truly great about this film . Aronosfky makes you feel the characters pain with his direction .
14343|5|The finest acting in the oughts ( 2000 to 2004 ) so far---the Academy shamefully overlooked Ellen Burnstyn . Her performance is the heart of this incredible or difficult film . You will not believe your eyes when you see what she goes through . Jennifer Connelly , Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans ( appearing in his first dramatic role ) are equally believable in this anti-drug film that does not glamorize its subject matter in the least . And it's brilliantly directed--you feel as if you are on the drugs with the characters , because of this direction . A perfect film .
14345|5|5 stars , but a reserved 5 stars . An excellent movie that was also incredibly offensive and revolting at the same time . Why , you ask ? The depictions of the lows of human nature which the characters enter are 100 % revolting and disgusting . If you have a weak stomach , are opposed to depictions of sex , violence , drug abuse , etc . , by all means DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE . For those who can appreciate the extremely strong anti-drug message in this movie and stomach watching it , you will not want to watch it again . Once is enough . However , one of the primary reasons I give 5 stars is its possible service to those considering / experimenting with / involved in drug use . If you catch your teenager using or experimenting with drugs , preview this movie and STRONGLY consider making them watch it . It is offensive , but it can serve a purpose . For that , and the fact that it is generally well made , I find I must give it a great rating , despite the fact that I wanted to vomit .
14347|5|This was an amazing film . I thought that the cinematography was fantastic , and all though it was quite graphic , the reality of it was very raw and drew me in . It is emotional and depressing , but enthralling and very well done . It is most definatley a movie that you need to watch closely and pay attention to- it is deep and detailed . 5 stars without a doubt .
14348|5|Great Film .
14349|5|This movie shocked me to no end- firstly because its in-depth , graphic look in the far-reaching use of drugs in America and secondly because the acting was incredible . By far one of the most depressing films ever but obviously the point of this film is not to entertain . It is an unconventional , disturbing piece meant to cause you to think . This film dragged me through so many emotions from disgust to empathy to nausea to extreme sadness . It is clearly not a mvie for the faint of heart as the depiction of these character's lives is relentless and painful . But its acting is magnificent and its storyline touches a deep chord in the heart .
 1435|5|A visual Masterpiece . Many of the actors smoked weed and dropped acid in order to really get into their roles . This movie has a gritty , surealistic feel that definitely benefits from the sacrifices and passion of Francis Ford Coppolla .
14350|5|Wow . This film was amazing , a true masterpiece . This movie really shows how drugs will destroy your life . The unique way the movie was filmed is what makes it so great , from each character's point of view . Yes , the ending is devastating , but what do you expect . Drug addiction usually doesn't lead to a happy ending . Even if you don't like sad movies , this movie will fascinate you and hold your full attention until the horrifying ending . This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen . .
14351|5|A disturbing , brilliant and heartbreaking movie . If anyone labels this as just another drug movie , they need to look deeper to see that Requiem shows how someones pursuit of happiness can become an addiction . Ellen Burstyn is someone you would never forget as Sara Goldfarb and in the end , it was painful to see her slowly . . . . rot . This movie must be shown to high schools when there is a lecture on drugs . Unfortunantley , due to some graphic content , that will probably never happen .
14352|5|Have to rate this a 5 just because of Ellen Burstyn's amazing acting alone . It is quite unusual to have a movie be so thought-provoking and hopefully will be a wake-up call to some who are into drugs . I had no idea what this movie was about when I put it on and it was surprising , depressing , but very outstanding and well done .
14356|5|this was a greatly powerful movie i used to be a user myself but have since cleaned up my act and that movie hit on every nerve of emotions i wet through and all the pain and suffering felt real . so real . almost to real well thats it this was a good movie
14360|5|Never has a film moved me so . I watched in awe the whole time . But the thing is , storyline = very average . Characters = so-so . But the filmmaking . . . f * ckin unreal . I would kiss the ground this director pisses on .
14362|5|First let me get a few random words of advice out of the way : 1 ) Don't see this movie on a first date , 2 ) Don't eat dinner while watching this movie , and 3 ) Don't see this movie expecting to feel good afterwards . Requiem for a Dream is one of the most disturbing movies I've seen . Everything about it makes you uncomfortable - the downward spiral of each character , the relentless music , the jagged filming and editing techniques . . . everything . The acting performances are universally excellent . Ellen Burstyn , especially , gives an amazing performance as the lonely widow and mother who falls victim to a diet pill addiction . This is clearly not a movie for everyone , but it's hard to give such an unconventional , powerful film anything less than five stars .
14364|5|ive never had a movie touch me as much as this one has . one of the most depressing movies i have ever seen , but one of the most honest movies i've seen . this a movie about drugs and how they can destroy a relationship between a mother and her son , two best friends , a perfectly happy couple . after this movie was over , i was in awe . i didn't know what to say . i didn't know who had it worse . i was just amazed . leto's performance was amazing , and it was great to see marlon wayans in a serious role ellen . . . man , just everyone gave an outstanding performance . great , great score too . beatifully directed . i'm shocked that they didn't take home any oscars . one of the best movies i have seen scince american beauty . a must see . . .
14367|5|As a person with some retired habits of a highly questionable nature , I feel comfortable informing you that this film does justice to the desperation and hopelessness of heroin addiction . The movie comes from the book by Hubert Selby , Jr . Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn give exceptional performances . This was as uncomfortable as I have been while watching a movie since seeing A Panic In Needle Park . It was so powerful that I didn't realize I had seen a great motion picture until much later in the evening . One of those films that makes you feel like you need a shower immediately after viewing .
14370|5|well what to say . . . do i give this movie a high rating becasuse it effected me so ? or do i give it a low rating because it didn't effect me in a nice way ? do i give it a high rating becase it changed me --in a blunt painful way--for the better ? or a low rating because i didn't feel good about the fact that the whole fcking movie was about drug addiction and the fact that drug ( andother ) addictions don't usually end happily ? Hmmm . . . this is a dilemma . . . i'm just really not sure . . i mean , i like puppy dogs , and there were none . . . that's a minus . . also i enjoy chocolate sundae's with peanuts on top , and i think the best i got was a shared icecream cone during the summer segment-- also the whole summer fall winter thing was stupid , becasue who wants to be left off in the middle of the cold winter ! what happened to spring huh ? i like spring , and the blooming of flowers like everyone else ! everyone likes flowers ! ! ! ! ! and yes , todd , i also agree with your point about nudity-- it would have been more than appropriate for what's her name to have gotten naked-- and ENJOYED it for god's sakes-- i mean c'mon , i agree , she's a really hot girl , so what's the problem ? hot girl should = sexy nudity scenes right ? of course it should ! is there some piece of the equation im missing ? ? seems fairly simple to me ! i mean if you think about it , if she would have gotten really sexy at that part where she has to go dance for all those old drunk men and stick that petrolem jelly dildo up her but because she has nothing left but drugs in her life and knows her boyfirend is as hopelessly addicted as she is and can't come back for the same reason-- she might have gotten even more money and drugs-- i mean if she wouldn't have been so emotional about the danm thing she could have made an even nicer profit and enjoyed herself at the same time ! golly , that director , and that writer man , sure are missing some common sense ! ! !
14372|5|This movie was brilliantly made and could go either way . Either you love it or you hate it . Even those who say they hate it won't dare take there eyes off of it from beginning to end . One of the greatest movies i ever saw .
14373|5|This film could quit possibly one of the most brilliant motion pictures ever made . No movie has ever made me feel the way this one did . I read the book over a year ago and this is one of the best book adaptions ever . Director Aronofsky is the next Stanley Kubrik . I cannot get over the performances , the visuals , the score out of my head since I saw it . This film will stick with me forever . Beautiful , dark , scary , depressing and brilliant . Can you smell the Oscars ? Mmmmmm . . . Oh and buy the way if you are seeing this movie just because you might have a chance to see T and A DO NOT GO SEE IT . Not only is there none but this movie is not about sex . It is about love , more specifically love gone wrong . NC-17 does not nesacarily mean nudity . Requien is a highly disturbing beauty of a film and if you are the T and A type who goes to a movie just so they can go home later and masturbate over the pair of breasts you saw instead of seeing it for the brilliant film it is Do NOT GO ! You can still love someone and make the wrong choices . We love ourselves as much as we love others . And when an addiction becomes so strong it destroys the emotions and the caring you have toward the ones you love that is love gone wrong . Yes it is about addiction and the depths of depravity people go to get their fix . Sex is in no way a key subject in this film . Yes sex is within the film , yes there is a little nudity , yes there is a graphic sex scene but this is just a means for getting the point of the film accros . Sex as a part in this film is just a side note . If such a deep and thought provoking film disapointed you for the lack of sex and nudity you need to step out of the SHALLOW kiddie pool and step into the BIG KIDS POOL . Sometimes there is more to life than sex . Like meaning . Just a thought .
14374|5|It is really great to see a movie that doesn't cop out at the end . Requiem For a Dream played at my local art theater ( for far too short of a run ) for about a week . I saw it twice . The first time I was completely blown away . I don't remember being so disturbed by a film . I loved it . Ellen Burstyn should get more than an oscar nomination . I can't remember when all of the aspects of film making came together so well as w / the ending of that film . Selby is a great writer . I can't imagine his words being put into film more effectively . Wish I could see it again for the first time !
14378|5|This is a GREAT film , not so much for the story content , which has been done before and will be done again , but for its presention . This is an all-out assault on the senses . . . visually , audially , emotionally . Ellen Burstyn gives an Oscar caliber performance that has you living her descent into addiction and psychosis right along with her . This is one actress Hollywood should start paying more attention to . . . her best work may still be yet to come .
14379|5|The first time I watched this movie I have to admit I was quite disturbed . The direction , script , acting and music were done so well that the emotional bang that hits you in the end is almost too much to bear . It was done so well that I was as close as I have ever been to walking out of the theatre because of the feeling the movie gave me . When the movie starts to spiral into the darkness that is the character's lives , you clench your fists together and pray for some glint of hope . The second time you watch Requiem for a Dream , you notice how beautiful the character's lives were at the beginning , and how the this time around its less disturbing and all around more depressing . A beautiful movie all around .
14381|5|I have no clue how to start . The movie is breath taking . Not only was there a superb case ( including ellen burstyn , jennifer conelly , jared leto , and marlon wayans ) but the effect the movie had on me was amazing . I had just finished reading the novel and immediately had to see the movie . the reality of it makes you sick to your stomach , but the reality keeps you from turning away . Marlon Wayans perfomed astoundingly well , a major turn from his somewhat comical roles he normally assumes . Ellen Burstyn's performance brought me to tears . I would highly recommend this show to any true movie fan .
14388|5|A wonderfull movie . George Lucas' look at growing up in California in the '60's . A must for any collection .
14391|5|If you haven't had your heart broken as a teen , wanted to fit in with the crowd , own a fast car , or hesitate to leave your friends after you graduate from high school , you couldn't identify with this movie . I'm not a teen anymore , but I sure recall those great memories . Wonderful movie . . .
14396|5|My favorite movie . It relates both to teens and adults ( former teens ) .
14399|5|really great movie . a classic . THE NEXT TIME I HAVE TO COME IN HERE , I'M CRACKING SKULLS !
  144|5|This is one great and scary movie . Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal Lector and Jodie Foster is almost his equal as the FBI agent . There are some great twists and the dialogue will keep you on the edge of your seat right until the end . Lector is the obvious bad guy , the embodiment of evil , but you find yourself mesmerized by him and rooting for him . This is not your slasher-type horror movie , but an incredibly suspenseful , brilliantly written thriller .
14401|5|This is a great 80s movie . its really funny . a great teen movie . this movie is a classic and it has a great soundtrack .
14406|5|This movie is definately in my top 5 greatest movies of all time . The whole cast was brilliant , and the movie was so believable . You laugh , you cry , and you just leave the movie feeling like you saw something worthwhile . I would definately recommend this coming of age movie to everyone . As always , John Hughes scores again ! A wonderful director with so much talent .
14414|5|This movie is a classic . And that's not just because it's a John Hughes' film . It is a very well done movie , with a great story and great acting . It is timeless and I think it is much better than many of the teenage films out today .
14420|5|This movie is moving up my favorites list everytime I watch it . The cast is terrific ( although , how can you go wrong with Julianne ? ? ) . It is a wonderful film and definitely deserves more credit and attention than it has received .
14421|5|Far From Heaven uses superb craftmanship to make this film look and feel like a film from the 1950s . It plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . One detail is particularly true to the time : interracial love and homosexual love are treated as being on different moral planes . Contemporary movies take so many subjects for granted that they never really look at them . Director Todd Haynes , by stepping back in time is able to bring these issues into focus . Cinematographer , Ed Lachman faithfully reproduces the lush 1950s studio style and every shot has the studied artiface of 1950s set decoration . The musical score , by Elmer Bernstein , is true to the time , with its underlining points and its punching-up emotions . I don't wish to give a synopsis of the movie's scenes except to say it is packed with power , incredible acting , and images that hit home . I had to find it showing in an art theatre as it never made major marquees . Catch if you can ! !
14422|5|loved it . it was soooo good and so sad and julianne was absolutely stunning ( as usual ) a must see
14423|5|A great contemporary film . Well-written , acted , and directed .
14424|5|My God . I don't think I have ever been so horrified by a film . One of the few times I have felt badly to be an American-the depiction of us standing idly by while this horror happened unnerved me .
14425|5|Had Don Cheadle and Sophie Okenedo been nominated for many prestigious awards would this movie have been viewed and raised awareness about whats going on not just in Rwanda , but Sierra Leone , Ethiopia and Uganda ? I don't think so . The BBC was the only channel in the world that covered what was going on and to me thats simply not enough , theres more value on human life than people think its just a pity an independent movie is showing people whats going on in the world .
14427|5|I am not a real big fan of people taking History lessons from Hollywood , however , I think this movie is one of the best mediums to teach young westeners that the Holocaust wasn't the only holocaust of the 20th Century . Canadian youth learn about the massacre briefly , too briefly actually , because of Canadian involvement in peacekeeping there . However , I don't know how much young Americans are taught on the subject , and I think that this movie is the best source to get the point across . Not a lot of people saw it , I know it won't win the Oscar for Best Picture , but I wish it would . Not for pretigue , but for recognition , so that more people will go and see it . I haven't seen any of the other movies up for the award ( don't really know WHAT movies are up for the award ) , but I can honestly say that this in one of the best movies I have seen in a while . One of the few movies I don't mind paying 10 + bucks to see in the theater . The only thing I found wrong was Nick Nolte and ambush scene . I felt it was too action-hero like .
14429|5|Chilling . Some time ago I did some freelance journalist work interviewing refugees of the massacres of the period . I heard stories I wish I could scrub from my mind , and I have twice interviewed serial killers . The movie was incredible , although a little grim .
 1443|5|The blood was meant to be overboard and comical . Q , as annoying a person he is , is a genius when it comes to making movies .
14430|5|This is a movie you catch for the history lesson , much more than the entertainment value . There's plenty to admire in the movie , though it's heavy subject matter . I'm glad I went last weekend , and felt ashamed I didn't know more about the million people systematically slaughtered during the mid-nineties in Rwanda's Holocaust of sorts . The lesson in the movie is why is makes sense for the UN and its supporting countries to intervene during a major international crisis , which happened too little too late in Rwanda . It's easy to relate to the family that the movie centers around , and seeing all the modern day conveniences in most every scene do much to defeat myths people have of lifestyles in Africa . Big props to the heroic real-life hotel manager who is excellently portrayed by Don Cheadle in the film .
14431|5|Predictably when you consider the subject matter , Hotel Rwanda is not a particularly uplifting movie . But it is an excellent one . Without giving anything away , Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a Hutu hotel manager of a four star hotel in Kigali who converted the hotel at which he worked into a refugee camp for Hutus and Tutsis during the 1994 massacre ( mostly by machete ) that slaughtered about 1M civilians . It's an extremely educational film - for example , I didn't know that the Hutu and Tutu designation had been arbitrarily assigned by the Belgian colonialists based on completely subjective physical attributes ( e . g . you're pretty tall , you shall be a tutsi ) . The movie does a really good job of showing that Kigali is a civilized , modern city - and the massacre that took place was not between two bloodthirsty tribes in the desert somewhere . But most of all , Hotel Rwanda illustrates with chilling , powerful simplicity what can happen with out of control partisanship , combined with hate radio , combined with animosity . My wife cried pretty much entirely through this movie , and parts of it are hard to handle . But it's worth seeing , if nothing else for the education , and to see the brilliant performance of Don Cheadle .
14436|5|Not in the top 10 ? Are you people crazy ? What a film ! EXCELLENT
14439|5|One of the greatest movies ever . This shows the life history of a great man . Very well presented with great acting and great characters .
 1444|5|not as good as Pulp Fiction but thats an unfair compaison . Kill Bill has an amazing story line and has many original parts ( anime and the black and white fighting scenes ) . I understand that the blood seemed fake but thats missing the point of the movie . For those who love blood and guts , HIGHLY RECOMMENED
14441|5|Quite intense emotionally as well as the individuals strength of character .
14443|5|An excellent film . This is not just a movie , but a film that should be rated among the classics of all time . It is a fine example of films on the grand scale , such as Cecil B . DeMille . What is more important is the subject of the film . Gandhi was an amazing man . A three hour film only touches the surface of this man . You will be transformed by the grace and dignity of the man and wonder why the world has not created more Gandhi's .
14444|5|Incredible !
14449|5|The most important film ever made of the most important person in the modern history ! Mahatma Gandhi is the closest I , as a humanist , come a God ! : o )
 1445|5|QT does it again !
14450|5|I have two favorite sports movies that stand out from the rest . . . Remember the Titans and Hoosiers . Both coaches came into hostile territory and proved how they could help shape the lives of high schoolers . High School sports can make or break young people but these two coaches in these two movies helped make responsible adults out of their athletes . What made Hoosiers even better was Dennis Hoppers performance . Hackman's character not only made men out of boys , but inspired a man to be a man too !
14451|5|Along with Remember The Titans , this has got to be the best sports movie of all time . Gene Hackman as always gave a great performance , as did Dennis Hopper as the drunk basketball fanatic who badly wants to get his life together , but can't seem to get his mind off the bottle . Its so surprising to me that this emotional story is actually true- its very rare espescially today to find anyone so dedicated to their job as Gene Hackman's character and his team was .
14452|5|Hoosiers will remain the greatest sports movie of all time . If you have only seen it on TV , you must rent a copy and see it all . TV almost always cuts out great dialog and scenes that are classics alone . What the movie doesn't tell you is that this small town team also had to win two games in the Semistate round and an afternoon game in the finals . This means they won two games a day three consecutive weekends after their Sectional to win the state . Not to mention they ( The Milan Indians ) went to the final four the year before ( 1953 ) . Milan had a total enrollment of 161 in 1954 . While you are at the video store , get a copy of Breaking Away . It's another underdog sports story that won Academy Award for Dialog .
14453|5|The only movie involving sports that ever interested me because it was so much more than that . A wonderful tale of the underdog all the way around on an off the basketball court . Gene Hackman does his usual stellar job of acting and giving us a very memorable character . Barbara Hershey also does a very believable job as his love interest . But the best performance of all was Dennis Hopper cast as the pathetic , washed up alcoholic father of one of the players . Absolutely excellent job - the best I ve ever seen from Hopper . The story , the music and the era are definitely compelling . I misted up from the start since , on a personal level , it really reminded me of my father . That was in great part due to the fact that they filmed the championship game at Hinkle Field House on the Butler University Campus ( Indianapolis , Indiana ) where my father attended college in the early 1950 s . So , of course , when the call went out for extras one of my cousins and I naturally answered it . Oh , yes , I m in Hoosiers even though you couldn t find me with a microscope ! LOL !
14455|5|Hoosiers is a terrific basketball movie . Gene Hackman stars as a new high school coach with a mysterious past , and his approach to coaching raises the eyebrows of his players and the townspeople alike . Hackman's character forges ahead , and eventually takes his team to the Indiana state finals . The build-up to the finals was very effective , and I found myself totally involved in the outcome . After living in a small town in Indiana for two years , I can attest to the fact that people really are that obsessed with basketball ! If you're looking for an absorbing , feel-good movie , try renting Hoosiers . You won't be disappointed .
14457|5|An old high school movie that is still great . My family is from IND , and it's a perfect representation .
14458|5|Great freaking movie ! Timeless tale of the underdog , all you have to do is tell it again and again in different situations with great acting ( or maybe even so so acting ) and you've got a hit . Just look at all the different versions of this story , Chariots of Fire , Rudy , Rocky , Raging Bull , on and on the list could go even to such stretches as It's a Wondeful Life ( he's an underdog ) . You make a film with a fella whose never gotten a fair break in life who scrapes his way to the top to win and you've got yourself a winner . Of course it didn't hurt that this film had some of the best actors of our time in it like Gene Hackman , Dennis Hopper , and let's not forget the lovely Barbara Hershey .
14459|5|Hoosiers is one of the best sports movies of all time . Based on a true story , it shows what can be accomplished if you work hard and believe in yourself and those around you . If it weren't based on a true story , you would almost think it is too unbelievable . Yet , that is what makes it so special . The actor who plays star player Jimmy Chitwood is great . Through very few words , he portrays the embodiment of the hopes of Indiana basketball . Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper are perfectly cast , as well . If you're looking to get pumped up before a big game , big night out , or an important meeting or interview , Hoosiers is the perfect choice .
14460|5|An important movie . Wrestlers have Vision Quest , boxers have Rocky , Nascar drivers have that bad Tom Cruise movie ( Days of Thunder ? ? ? ? ) - clearly it's important that high school basketball teams have an inspirational movie to get them fired up for that big game . And this movie does the trick . Gene Hackman does a great job as the coach of the Hickory Huskers , and Dennis Hopper does a nice job as the drunk , but knowledgable basketball junkie . One of those movies that it's almost impossible not to like .
14462|5|Well acted and a great story . Made me very nostalgic for the early '70's just before the music business became too corporate . Phillip Seymour Hoffman was absolutely brilliant .
14463|5|I have probably seen this movie easily 50 times as I would consider it my favorite movie of all time . I would agree with an earlier comment that it does leave you with a rather empty feeling , as it has a bittersweet ending , but I think with a title like Almost Famous I didn't view the movie expecting to see the feel-good movie of the year . I thought it was real , and a very deep look at human nature and emotions , and is not just a movie about what life was like for rock stars in the 70's , but for all people in any time period . I thought Kate Hudson was amazing . She was the perfect actress for this movie . The rest of the cast was absolutly perfect as well . There was just enough humour , executed perfectly , to make Almost Famous fairly light hearted without taking away from the drama . The soundtrack is fantastic as well , I just paused through the credits and wrote down every song , as they are all fantastic , and the actual soundtrack should have been about 4 disks , 1 doesn't do it justice .
14465|5|One of my favorite films , this is based on the life of director Cameron Crowe during his days as a teenaged journalist for Rolling Stone . Patrick Fugit plays the main character with fresh-faced youth and vulnerability . His journey to adulthood as he travels with a rock band is compelling and wildly entertaining . Kate Hudson plays the groupie with a heart charmingly and the rest of the cast is terrific . A huge plus of this film is its wonderful soundtrack filled with great , classic rock . I just can't stop raving about this movie .
14467|5|Really loved this movie , was very well made and Billy Crudup made for a great depiction of a 70's guitarist .
14468|5|One of the best coming of age films I've ever seen . I was highly impressed , and this film makes my A list . I was unfortunatly unable to see this film until after it came to cable . However , this film does not require the big screen to come through . The film is beautifully set , and extremely funny . This film is somewhat autobiographical , and the circumstances of the characters as well as their depth allow that to come through . If you enjoy 70's period pieces , or even if you just like a good comedy , I recommend that you see this flick .
14469|5|patrick fugit was soo real . you could not help but like him . Mr . FUGIT MADE THIS MOVIE FOR ME . I look forward to seeing him in his next film .
14471|5|I love this movie it was everything i ever wanted out of a movie , it had comedy , romance , drama , and a light sence to it that made you want to be in it . Kate Hudson i though never could act , but in this movie her smile and inocence made me think wow . I loved everyone on this movie , even if yo werent supose to , it was just so amazing .
14474|5|Really really really good movie . . . i am not gonna say anything but you gotta see it if you are into lots of music
14477|5|this movie is so endearingly honest that you can tell cameron crowe is truly trying to get it all out and really express himself . i could really feel the amount of emotion he put into it , including his love of the rock and roll classics . it has an understated tone to it which is probably what i liked most about it .
14478|5|I really just loved this movie . I think it explains a lot ! Also i luv Kate Hudson and i think she is an excellent actress and only more room to get better !
14480|5|best movie ever , really . it makes you actually FEEL GOOD , it showcases a bunch of actors ( except for Frances McDormand ) that you really didn't think had such great performances in them , but they truly do . Kate Hudson is a guaranteed oscar winner , her face that graces the cover and steals every scene is priceless .
14482|5|great plot great acting great characters great music great ending . i truly enjoyed this movie , and i think i could see it again and find it equally entertaining . . . the plot is well developed and many-layered , and the actors do wonders with it . even if that weren't the case , it would be worth seeing just for the great soundtrack . 5 stars .
14483|5|I was really impressed by this movie . The story line was great with a lot of emotion .
14489|5|Almost Famous is the best movie I have seen in the last six months . This movie is strong in every element . The casting was amazing . The film gives a great view of the 70s rock and roll scene through the eyes of a young writer . I found the script very unmanipulated , and I never felt as though I was hit over the head with any point or emotion . I found myself in tears at one point in the movie and I was not sure why . I believe it was the sincerity of the story and the telling of it that moved me to tears . The most memorable moments were not words at all , but instead visual images that contained much power and emotion . I would recomend this film to anyone who can appriate a good story , a good cast , and a heartfelt experience .
 1449|5|Better than Vol . 2 ( which , by the way was outstanding ) , Kill Bill : Volume 1 has the following superlatives -- 1 ) Best Martial Arts Flick ever ; 2 ) Best homage to the 1970s ever . More obscure references [ to that decade ] than a 5-hour Dennis Miller rant ; 3 ) Best Musical Soundtrack ever ; 4 ) Best Girlpower Flick ever ( My , my , how Uma has evolved since playing the helpless femme in Dangerous Liaisons ) ; 5 ) While I think Tarantino is an outright jackass ( particularly by giving fathead turncoat Moore the Palm D'Or ) , you must marvel at his masterful directorial skills and cinematography ; 6 ) Most violent film I ever saw ( though most of the bloodshed is in the Roadrunner vs . Wile E . Coyote variety ) .
14492|5|This movie was AWESOME ! The movie was very well-directed , the actors did a great job , even though I expected a little less from some of the new-comers , and the writing was great . Patrick Fugit did a great job portraying a naive and caring boy who learns a life lesson , not to mention that he has a lot of talent and will be a big star . This movie gets two of my thumbs up !
14493|5|I was really impressed with 'Almost Famous' . It had a lot of starting out actors but they were all fantastic . The story is about a high school guy who is a really good writer . He gets a job with Rolling Stone ( RS has no idea he is so young ) to write a story about an up and coming band . He goes on tour with them but along the way a story that is sad , funny , exciting , adventerous , and romantic develops . This movie had it all . One thing I look for in a good movie whether it is a horror , romantic comedy , or an action adventure movie is if I get attacthed to the characters . 'Almost Famous' did the job . I was into all the characters . It has so many different messages intertwined in the movie . The music is amazing with a lot of Led Zeppelin . It is a really good date movie . I have just heard some breaking news this weekend about 'Almost Famous' that I had to come back and share . This news makes me like the movie ten times more now . This movie is based upon the directors life . He used to write for Rolling Stone magazine and follow bands like Zeppelin around when he was a teenager . There really is a Penny Lane . This news has changed my rating and I now have to give it a 5 start rating .
14497|5|Not many actors could pull off being on screen for a major potion of a movie alone , and make it interesting and belieavable , but Tom Hanks pulls it off wonderfully . One of the great acting challenges of our time , and Tom Hanks lives up to expectations . He gives an Oscar-worthy performance , and propably would have won had he not already captured two other awards earlier in his career His co-star , Wilson , really stole the show and became the star everybody loves . Helen Hunt did her best in what essentially was a throw-away role , a role that was poorly written . Her photo in the locket was the real preformance here . Still , CASTAWAY remains one of IJR's favorite flicks and IJR says check it out ! !
  145|5|Excellent film . No cheese in this film . Jodi Foster played a convincing investigator . The suspense was maintained throughout the film , especially the garage scene . You never knew what horrible Lector was going to say or do . I like the last line , I'm having a friend for dinner .
14504|5|The only reason people say they don't like this movie is beacuse it's either boring or stupid because he talks to a volleyball . Those people obviously can't sit for a couple of hours and witness an excellent movie . Tom Hanks gives another huge performance . Much of the film contains no dialogue , but still delivers a powerful and memorable experience .
 1451|5|Tarantino takes all the best from the martial arts genre and packs it into one great , tongue-in-cheek classic .
14511|5|An exceptional movie . After all of the lukewarm comments on this page , I didn't have very high expectations for this film . What Cast Away delivered was a phenomenal performance by Tom Hanks , a couple of chilling action scenes , and a very un-Hollywood ending . The storyline of a man stripped of everything but his survival instincts pitted against the awesome and unpredictable power of nature is a powerful one . If you haven't gotten around to seeing this movie because of all the hype / mixed press it received , you should wait no longer - Cast Away is a real winner .
14513|5|Cast Away was an excellent movie , although some of the scenes with the waves didn't look that great , I thought Tom Hanks did an excellent part in this movie .
14520|5|It's a great movie !
14521|5|Great movie ! Tom Hanks did a fantastic job ! Wilson was cool--- though silent . The plane crash was awesome . The island part was a good touch . It showed the harshness that can be encountered by a man that has very little survival skills . I liked the ending . The crossroads idea was great ! Of the 4 choices , I believe that I would have followed the pick-up truck . This is definitely a 'must see' movie !
14525|5|Suffer . . Suffer . . . ! God it got to the point where I was literally squirming in my seat . . . ! Enough is enough . . . ! It showed much intelligence in a city boy turned primal man on a deserted island however . Tom Hanks surprized me on this a bunch . . . ! Didn't even begin to think a dude like he could handle it . The relationship he had going was so good in the movie . And even tho it required tremendous strength on Tom's part to do as he did towards the end . . . . that really pissed me off to see her where she ended up and in doing so put Tom after all he'd been through . The ending really bozzled me . . . . . . a bunch !
14526|5|This film definetly made me cry . It's effort and thought really payed off ! However , it did have a similarity to the story Hatchet that I've seen and read . But this story leads you to a big surprize . I just wish they didn't leave ya hanging at the end .
14531|5|Awesome plot ! A movie that grows on you . You wanna know what happens next . I would reccommend this movie to just about anyone .
14532|5|I put seeing this movie off for a while because of its length , finally saw it this past weekend . It certainly falls in the category of different . Other than the plane crash , it doesn t really have any true action or suspense , but for some strange reason I couldn t pull myself away from wondering what was going to happen next . Now you might say , well that s suspense , it was and it wasn t . There have been a lot of films put out that tried to tap human suffering , or the human condition . Cast Away didn t just tap it , it tapped a main line feed from the core . Tom Hanks was brilliant , how many actors can take up over half of a movie solo and never loose an audience ? Not many . I see some questioning the ending , at first I was a little miffed at its , seemingly clich who knows how what decision will be made ending . However , the more I thought about it , how else could it end . Anything else would have been considered predictable , too convenient , too wrapped up in a pretty bow . I thought the ending fit rather nicely within the whole theme of life sucks but not really too awful bad .
14533|5|this was an interesting movie and it had some funny parts in it which is awesome . I like most all of Tom Hank's movies .
14546|5|i loved and i also that at the end it showed what would happend in real life . so it is great .
14547|5|If you are looking for a feel good movie with a happy ending , this isn't the movie to go watch . It is more of a one man performance and Hanks is simply brilliant as always . He has become that man we love to have sit next to us and we always love to hear him speak . While I would have loved to see a little more inbetween time , I loved the movie and was on the edge of my seat for the crash scene . Hanks has reached such I high level in acting ability that he is reaching a point where we will be disappointed in anything that isn't a 5 star movie .
14548|5|Well , let's just say I was surprised . Hanks and Zemekis and a great film .
 1455|5|I can understand if people didnt like it because it was slow , but i think it was a really good looking movie .
14552|5|I thought the movie was wonderful . It didnt really leave me hanging as everyone said it would . Certain signs that he had while on the island made him realize his paths , and the same when he returned to civilization . It wasnt really that confusing to figure out that he went back to know and fall in love with that women at the cross roads . I thought the movie said alot about life in general . that he was so worried about time and rushing that he would forget what was really important , was the people in his life , and when he was on the island he had nothing BUT time . It made me laugh it made me cry . as of any movie that Robert Zameckis and Tom Hanks are involved in . I give it two thumbs up ! ! ! ! !
14554|5|If you appreciate what we have and don't take things for granted , this movie will open your eyes . Just keep an open mind , and it is a great movie .
14555|5|Oh my ! I couldn't wait to see this movie and I was not dissappointed ! Tom Hanks' character goes through so much and you feel it all with him ! The crash scene was spectacular ( Iwas holding my breath ) , watching him survive in the island was amazing ( you feel his lonliness yet will to survuve ) , and then watching him try to readjust back into a society after being alone for so long was heart-wrenching ( post truamatic stress syndrome . . . ) . I would see it again ! Helen Hunt also does a great job ! It was the best movie I have ever seen with such little dialog ! Go see it !
14558|5|I loved the movie ! It included so many different kinds of feelings . Sometimes you cry , other times laugh , grip on the edge of your chair , smile ! I thought the ending fit . It reflected what Noland told his friend after he lost Kelly all over again . The sun will come up in the morning and you never know what the tide might wash up !
14560|5|It puzzle me to think how people could have not liked this movie . It was so well planned out and directed that this movie is clearly Oscar Wworthy . Also to mention Tom Hanks perhaps did one of his best works ever . One point that I disagree with people is that the beach scene dragged too long . I disagree because The audience needed to see exactly what it was like to be stranded on an island , fending for yourself
14562|5|Little known fact , but the sequel is about the further adventures of Wilson . Apparently , after he floats off into the sunset , he's picked up by a kung-fu / volleyball master ( played by Michelle Yeoh ) who's immigrating to America by boat . Yeoh catches the bad guys by spiking Wilson at them .
14563|5|Great movie ! There's a lot more to this movie than meets the eye ! If you're looking for an adventure movie , you'll be disappointed . If you hate movies that have an 'open' ending , you will hate it . I think the ratings showm at this website reflect this . This is a movie about life itself and about the choices that we've made and will make . Many have criticized the ending . At the end of the movie , Tom Hanks has some new choices to make . The movie does not indicate exactly what he does . This is the way that the movie HAD to end because there is a certain amount of logic to each of the different choices that he could have made . This is what fascinates me about this movie . I love to ask people which choice do you think he made . Their responses are varied an always subject to debate . I'm not a touchy-feely kind of guy ( I got my degree in Accounting and things HAVE to balance , damn it ! ) . But Cast Away really moved me .
14564|5|I seen this movie 5 times and I hope to see it again . The ending said it all , as chuck was standing at the crossroads of his life . we must live with the choices we make , good or bad . This movie was true to life .
14568|5|Cast Away still has me thinking about what life would be like living on a deserted island for 4 years with practically nothing . Tom Hanks did a spectacular job in this role . The movie was very realistic both in the beginning , middle , and end . I know many people didn't like the end , I thought it made the movie even better cause lets face it , not everything has a good ending and it made it realistic . The special effects were good and I liked how the dialog was minimal as well as the musical score . This movie was wonderful
 1457|5|very entertaining . its hard to not pay attention to this movie . i kinda have concern for anyone in a comma now . if you seen it you know what i'm talking about . they went way to far with the blood in this movie . it seems like even a minor papercut in this movie would shoot blood like a fire hose . but thats just my exageration . the action and the fighting in this movie are preety badass .
14578|5|great film
14579|5|One of the most unforgettable and moving films of the last 3 decades . This performance by Meryl Streep is an unequalled masterpiece . Also great performances by Kevin Kline and Peter MacNichol . The story is heartbreaking and poignant . Magnificent !
 1458|5|This film has a great story AND its brilliantly violent and bloody . This movie is one of the best in action movies ( well of all the ones ive seen . ) Its not for everyone . . so for all those people rating ones and twos . . . . you suck .
14580|5|A flawless piece .
14584|5|OMG This is the most beautiful movie ever its so sad and julianne more and meryl streep do amazing performances it one of those movies that makes you appreciate life
14588|5|Can I stretch the word excellent ? Yes , I can . Great performances , excellent screenplay . Ed Harris is amazing .
14591|5|This IS Apocalypse Now to me , having not seen the original version . Personally , I see nothing wrong with this film . It is perfect in every way . Very surreal , very disturbing . Certainly one of the best examples of cinema at its finest .
14595|5|I am white , I love African-American movies that are dramas including drugs , violence and language . Ice Cube is by far my favorite actor , he is brilliant . I remember watching this movie whenever it came out in 1991 . . . whenever I was just 11 and thinking --- WOW ! ! ! Now that I am 24 , 11-06-04 --- I understand it alot better and just makes me feel sorry for people living in South Central . This movie is one of the best movies of all time in my book . 2 thumbs up !
14597|5|This movie best describes the African American society where blacks were all segregated in one area and where chaos drives many of them to violence . True film that shows how bad things were .
14599|5|The movie was very cultural as itt showed an aspect of African American society . The plot was well directed .
  146|5|Can you love a horror movie ? If you see this you will . Anthony Hopkins should still be winning awards for this film . I think if I saw him on the street today I would be a little afraid ! Each minute of the film builds the suspense and even if you have to cover your eyes at the more graphic parts , the dialogue will carry you through without missing a beat .
14600|5|I loved this movie . It was hella real . The topic was real . The actors were very talented . Very entertaining . The movie was very sad . I loved it . I still watch it to this day !
14603|5|This movie gives people a real glimpse into the world of the underpriviledged . It shows the pressures put onto young black men and the temptations they face . It also shows the way of life , when the promising football guy gets shot .
14604|5|Boyz is a classic . Cuba Gooding Jr . is great and Ice Cube is a great character surprisingly . It captured the attitude of the times and location while still having a sense of humor about the gangster society . The soundtrak is a good mix of oldies and new songs .
14605|5|This was a great movie about life in the ghetto and the realness of a black man in the hood . But what made this movie stand out is how Trey's father was hard on him and he was the only one to make it out of the hood .
14606|5|An all time great ghetto movie . Very exciting . Shows a very realistic view from the life in the streets . Will be watched by many forever . It's a movie everyone should have in their collection .
14609|5|I thought this movie sent a lot of good messages . It made you think and realize things like why there are liquor stores on every corner in black neighborhoods and why blacks are killing blacks . It was sad yet uplifting . I thought it was pretty realsitic too .
14610|5|This movie is hella tight . Growing up in lower middle America you see this everyday- not to this extreme , but close enough . I love seeing good people in bad situations overcome . Good for Trey .
14611|5|One of the best gangsta movies of all time . It shows the life of South Central LA and has excellent acting performances by Cuba Gooding Jr .
14612|5|A great movie . I've lived in Vallejo most of my life and some bad stuff goes down that takes many star athletes out of the pros . Gangs , crimes , or just jealousy .
14614|5|This was a great movie . It was real and to the point . The happy ending was not cheesey . It was warming to the heart . It was also a great debut for Nia Long and Cuba Gooding Jr .
14615|5|This movie was very moving . It expressed the true life of the ghetto and how life was for others . Although I couldn't relate to it myself , it was very emotionally moving .
14618|5|This was a realistic movie about the HOOD ! I used to live in the Hood and it brought back memories .
14619|5|best of its genre .
14622|5|This was a great movie . It was emotional and you felt for the characters . Great storylines . The best movie ! ! !
14623|5|Boyz N the Hood is a urban classic that'll never die !
14629|5|I thought this movie was going to be a typical whodunit , but this movie surprised me by having many layers . Sean Penn earned his Best Actor Oscar with his skillful portrayal of Jimmy , whose daughter is murdered . Jimmy is more complex than he appears at the beginning of the movie , and is not just a grieving dad . Penn's acting in this movie convinced me that he is the Marlon Brando of my generation . Tim Robbins is also deserving of praise as the psychologically scarred Dave , who is still trying to come to grips with a childhood trauma . Tim Robbins portrays Dave as a sensitive , but wounded , gentle giant . I agree with a previous poster who stated that Mystic River should have won Best Picture and Best Director . Mystic River posesses an immediacy that a dopey fable like Lord of the Rings sadly lacks .
14630|5|Now I have seen a lot of movies but this by far is my favorite I love it . I can not wait until I go to the movie store next time because I am buying this on dvd . If you havent seen this Here is a HELPFUL hint see the movie it is amazingly greatness clint eastwood at his best .
14632|5|simply amazing . . best movie i saw last year by far . . i thought the three main characters were so different and so complex . . was really good fun watching it . . had its own nice pace . . wasnt hurried at all . . beautifully made . . i especially liked kevin bacon . . he put up a very strong performance . . all together . . controversies aside . . sean penn deserved best actor . . i thot clint eastwood shouldve won too . . beautiful story . .
14633|5|Should've won best picture , and director .
14634|5|One of the best films I saw last year . What I liked about it is that there were no special effects or big budget hollywood studios sticking their ore in , just a movie making room for sheer entertainment . Throughout this movie the story keeps you interested , the character's are real the dialogue's convincing not to mention outstanding performances from the children to the adults . A well told story , Clint Easwood is truly a extra-ordinary story teller .
14638|5|I think this was a really great movie , one of my favorites , I have seen it so many times I forgot how many times I have seen it . The dancing is sooo good , it makes me wish I could be a ballet dancer myself . And I agree with Circe , the guy who plays Charlie is very hott ! ! : )
14639|5|All my friends were talking about how great Center Stage was but I had never seen it . I rented it last night and watched it 4 times already . I have to buy it now because I love it so much . it sort of makes me wish that I could dance like that !
14641|5|It is only the best movie ever made . It disscuses a lot of the major issues of todays world . It also presents characters that you can relate to and love .
14643|5|There's only one word to describe it , Inspirational ! Even if you are not a dancer you will watch the dancing with awe and just feel motivated in whatever you want to become in life , and you're bound to feel like dancing . One of the greatest dance movies of all time ! !
14644|5|I'm a dancer of 9 years and I have never seen such excellent dancing in a movie . I LOVED it .
14645|5|I loved this movie . . . . It has been put onto my fave list . If you like movies that have romance and dreams coming true this is a movie to watch . . the acting by the guy who played Cooper wasn't that great but other than that the movie was good . I loved the plot and Amanda-Jody was awsome . This movie helped me see that with hard work even I can achieve my dreams . . . I LOVED IT .
14646|5|It was a great movie for anyone who would be able to enjoy a movie with dance . It shows how hard it is to be a dancer and that some things are worth working hard for
14647|5|I loved this film ; it makes you want to dance right in your seat .
14648|5|Me , being a dancer completely appreciated the movie . All those who said that the movie was missing a plot have to understand that difficulties it is to be a dancer . Even as a little kid they pick out every detail about you . They show that detail great in the movie . I personaly thought that this movie was excellent , and the dancing was awesome ! There's this one part where they show Eva working hard on her dancing at night . . . and anyone who's a dancer can understand what thats like ! Excellent movie ! I totally reccomend it to any dancers out there . . . not too much for guys though . . .
 1465|5|Fantastic ! An energetic , colourful slice of martial arts mayhem , with a great female lead , wonderful fight scenes and absolutely spot-on music . The music alone is woth seeing this film for . As for the violence , it's a Tarentino movie ! ! You knew that before you went to see it so why see a Tarentino flick if you morally object to the severing of body parts ? It seems slightly masochistic to me to watch a violent film if you're squeamish .
14653|5|i thought this was such a good movie ! it made you want to get up and dance . it was very inspirational and gave me confidence as a dancer ! ! !
14654|5|man , i luved the movie . i have watched it about 20 times . i'm a dancer for 13 years . i've never felt like dance this way until i saw the movie . its an inspiration
14655|5|An awesome movie that makes you feel great ! The dance scenes are the bomb !
14656|5|I LOVED IT ! ! ! ! ! ! 1
 1466|5|I did not like Pulp Fiction . However , I do love this movie , and can't wait for part 2 . Great homage to kung fu movies with a definite injection of american style . Very violent , definitely not for kids . The movie is full of symbolism and obscure references that many people will not get .
14660|5|I thought the movie was excellent . It portrayed young adults working hard to achieve their dreams . This movie is highly recommended .
14665|5|I believe it was a great movie , that Matthew guy is a real babe .
14666|5|THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER DONE ! I loved it , and have seen if Four times while in the theater . THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT MOVIE !
14673|5|I loved it ! If you danced ballet when you were younger , you will fall in love with this movie and want to go back to ballet .
14676|5|It was very inspirational and nice to see another aspect of American culture being recognized . I had never realized how difficult it was to be a dancer and get a position in a dance company .
14678|5|This movie was a fantastic adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel . House of Mirth skillfully portrays a young woman in late 19th century New York society who makes a few dumb mistakes , and is harshly punished for them . Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were marvelous in the leading roles , and should have been at least been nominated for Oscars . But if you're looking for a movie that will make you feel good movie don't rent this one . House of Mirth will break your heart .
 1468|5|I do love Tarintino's work and after watching this I feel he has excelled himself . The direction in this film is just simply beautiful . This doesn't been much meaningful spoken dialogue as the action , movement and reaction of the characers is enough for you to know what is going on . There is an interesting mix of film and animation which gels wonderfully . The fighting scenes are choreographered to perfection . Well worth seeing and I am definately going to see the second one .
14687|5|This movie is in my top 10 greatest movies of all time . I loved the drama this movie had ! The ending made me feel great , too . Erin is definately someone to look up to in this world . There are so few like her left anymore . This movie was also the first movie made by Julia Roberts that was good . I never thought that day would come .
 1469|5|I have to admit I did not like Q . T . previous work but Kill Bill is awsome
14692|5|Okay , I admit I'm biased as a single mom of three kids who would like to think that someone like me could do something so amazing . But really , she was just working hard and stumbled upon something that , even if I were her , few could turn their back on . I liked this movie for some of the more subtle scenes that depict the heartache of a mother who must work to keep food on the table . The best scene was when she was in her car coming back from Hinkley late at night and heard about her baby's first word . Julia Roberts acted in that scene as any other mom whose heart was broken over missing such an important moment would . I cried with her . I tell any single person that doesn't seem to get what it is like for me to watch this movie . Those that took my advice come back and say that they had no idea what true juggling was . I don't agree with her outspoken way of behaving sometimes , but in all she is to be admired .
  147|5|One of the best horror / thriller movies of the 90s . Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal the Cannibal Lector , and Jodie Foster who usually annoys me does a great job as the inexperienced but determined Agent Starling . This movie comes back to haunt me occasionally , because a friend of mine does a funny-but-also-upsetting imitation of the scene where the guy says , She puts the lotion in the bucket If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs , you should also check out a great but lesser-known movie called Manhunter . It was based on a book ( called Red Dragon ) written by Thomas Harris the same guy who wrote Silence of the Lambs .
 1470|5|best movie ever quentin out did himself
14700|5|Erin Brockovich would definately be on my top ten list of great movies . I feel it deserves a much higher placement on this RateItALllist because not only was it a riveting , interesting , timely film circling on an important issue , it was based on a true story and landmark legal case ! And if any of you reading think I only really like it so much because I'm a big Julia Roberts fan , think again because I was one of the very few people who hated Pretty Woman . Actually I didn't think Roberts was good in any of her many films , except maybe Sleeping With the Enemy . - But in Erin Brockovich , Roberts really amazed me ! She not only performed the part flawlessly , but she just seemed to belong to the story . She was one with the story and the spirit of the story . Julia Roberts deserved her Academy Award for this film .
14701|5|Julia was great in this film and she deserves every award she gets ( and all those she doesn't ! ) . This film deserves the highest kudos !
14702|5|great movie !
14707|5|This is a great movie for both guys and girls . It's kind of long , but you don't notice because you are so into the movie . It's great to see with a big crowd because everyone will be cheering her on .
14712|5|Go ahead and give Julia her academy award ! ! !
14715|5|I just need to know if Erin Brockovich ever married George ? I noticed that her name is now Erin Brockovich-Ellis . But , it never tells us anywhere in the movie , or in the credits , what George's last name is .
14721|5|An overall enjoyable movie . The wise cracks were great . But wardrobe was a bit over the top . I could really feel for the victims in the movie .
14724|5|We need more post-feminist movies ! Julia Roberts made the movie perfect with her popularity . I definitely went to see it because of Julia Roberts celebrity .
14725|5|A movie based on reality which depicts a very good story with superb acting . Very well presented and documented .
14726|5|This movie was cool . I really felt for the victims of PG E's conspiracy . And I was really glad that Erin was able to expose them . Great story and acted well . Julia is the bomb !
14727|5|Had all the ingredients necessary for a great movie : strong plot , good dialogue , romance , intrigue , and a leading lady who was as exceptional an actress as she was beautiful . This is one of the most well done David and Goliath stories I have seen in a long time . I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone , regardless of their movie prefs .
14729|5|Steven Soderbergh is Jesus Christ with a movie camera . It was a commercial film that stayed true to the filmmaker's style . Julia Roberts was excellent , as was the supporting cast . Despite the well known story , the movie was well done and extremely entertaining .
 1473|5|Amazing ! I loved it .
14732|5|I enjoyed seeing female actors in strong roles . The movie was a good vehicle for Julia Roberts to strut her stuff .
14735|5|Only a few words describe this wonderful , wonderful movie . Women rule ! When I left this movie , I felt like I could do anything despite what people throw in my path .
14736|5|The movie turned out to be a lot better than I thought . It has a lot of comedy with a good story to it .
14737|5|I love Julia Roberts . It is a great story as well . Even her swearing didn't bother me . It was an interesting story in comparison to her prior films .
14738|5|Good movie -- both my husband and I enjoyed it ! I had to convince him to go . He said it was funnier than he expected -- he was glad he went !
14739|5|This movie is great ! ! Julia Roberts gives her best performance . I agree she should be , at the least , be considered for an Oscar nomination . As for her dress code in this movie , I've heard from my friend that the true Erin said in Oprah that her actual dressing style is even more revealing than Robert's in the film . So , for those of you who feel offended with the sexy style , just know that the real Erin dressed even sexier than that . What's up with that , anyway ? I've seen women dressed sexier than Robert in the film . Didn't you see Jennifer Lopez ? ?
14740|5|This is a very fast-paced , interesting movie . While the subject matter may be somewhat serious , it still ends up being a feel-good movie in the end . The story has a few interesting twists , and the exploration of the protagonist's family life is quite uncommon . Julia Roberts is fantastic as Erin and she should be nominated for an Academy Award .
14742|5|It's a great movie about being a working mom . The portrayal of this sharp tongued character who is quick to take offense , but still manages to enlist people in her cause was incredibly effective . I could have done with less of the bra straps showing all the time .
14752|5|Historically accurate . . . and it even shows you that both sides were murderous SOBs .
14756|5|IMHO so far it's the best movie I've seen in cinemas in the year 2001 . True that it hasn't been a great year , but true also that this is a good film . Good storyline , good script , wonderful acting ( Jude Law and Ed Harris ) , good score .
14763|5|This was an extrodaniry movie .
14764|5|A classic movie that deserves a better rating for it's great view of the difficulties of slaves .
14768|5|A wonderful movie . It gives a slightly different twist to history .
14770|5|The most moving film I have ever seen . It changed the way I thought .
14771|5|Amistad was a great movie because it proved that the law was made out for all people , not judging among color .
14773|5|Talk about a great movie , this is the one . If you've never cried or laughed in a movie then this is the one for you . It gave me a better understanding of how afro-americans were treated back then . It gave me a whole new outlook .
14777|5|One of the most under-rated movie the world has seen the best Spielberg-movie ! Amazing acting ! : o )
14781|5|I loved this movie . I recently rented it and it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time . The setting of this movie is wonderful . It takes place in a small french village and it is absolutely beautiful ; it made me wish I was there . This movie had a great message to it , and the differences in the characters was enlightening .
14782|5|Johnny Depp is one of the best actor's in Hollywood and this movie proves that . This movie was so sweet and loving . I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen . Johnny Depp is soo sexy . I wish I could of played Juliette Binoche part .
14783|5|This is a heart-warming , beautiful movie . I couldn't get over it after I saw it , it was so beautiful . Binoche , Molina , Dench , Depp , the whole damn cast ( including The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss ) are perfect . I felt like having some chocolate after seeing this . Other than the fact it's a French villiage and they all speak English with French Accents ( what're they gonna do ? ) , this was a beautiful movie . Recommended . Summary : A BEAUTIFUL HART-WARMING MOVIE .
14792|5|I really enjoyed Chocolat . The movie is about a woman ( Vianne , played by Juliette Binoche ) and her daughter who move to a small , provincial town in France and open a chocolate shop . The town's mayor is not pleased with Vianne and what he thinks she represents , and he attempts to sabotage her . The story develops nicely , with several interesting sub-plots , and the acting is terrific . I'm not surprised in the least that Juliette Binoche was nominated for Best Actress for her role in this movie . Johnny Depp and Judi Dench are both great , too . Although the movie deals mostly with relationships , it moves at a good pace and is never boring . If you're looking for a nice movie without a lot of violence or sleaze , Chocolat would be a good choice . I suggest arming yourself with a bar of chocolate before entering the theater . . .
14794|5|Sergio Leonne's final , loving ode to the medium he adored is possibly his best . The greatest poets can describe the ineffable through words , but Leonne , the filmmaker , can the describe the indescribable without using words . One of the first scenes , where Noodles ( De Niro ) , as an old man , returns to the bar that was the focal point of so much of his storied life , is a perfect example of this . The camera pans gradually and contemplatively over black and white pictures as Noodles looks agape , lost in his memories . He then slowly walks towards what appears to be an unremarkable closet or storage area , but Noodles , and the film , treats it as if it were hallowed ground . Entering the closet , he gazes through a small opening in the wall and sees the elegant dancing of the girl he used to spy upon as a pubescent boy , now looking mournfully into his lost youth . As I watched , I felt deeply affected , as if the old Italian director had somehow communicated to me what it was like to look back on a lifetime of memories . I was so profoundly moved , and the film had barely even started yet ! The movie documents the life of Noodles and his friends , young hoodlums in prohibition-era America , and how they grew from boys to men , and from small-time thieves to established gangsters . An intriguing duality is raised because as the boys grow in their capacity for crime , so too does their sense of loyalty and love towards one another . Through the course of life though ( especially one of a criminal ) , the capacity for loyalty is tested by ambition , and love can stray into the darker shades of obsession . As disarmingly whimsical as the film can often be , it has equal capacity to be extremely grim and disturbing . It's truly a biopic that explores both the very best and the very worst aspects of humanity . Make sure to catch the full , unedited 227 minute version of the film , as though the movie is long , not a second of Leonne's final masterwork is missable .
14795|5|The thing I like about Sergio Leone is that when watching his movies , and especially this one , you have the feeling that he holds nothing back in terms of reality . I mean , this man would be capable of showing s * * t in his movies , if it serves a artistic purpose . But it is not realistic a la news , it is also full of poetry , feelings , imagery . This combo between gritty realism and feelings is mastered uniquely by Leone . As for the actors . . . LOVED every performance . Even the very small roles were excellent . 1 last word : WOW !
14798|5|I can understand that some people would find the deliberate , methodical pace of this film as off-putting , but I think if you take it in the context of the social and class relationships of that time , you glean a new understanding of the film . To me , it is amazing the amount of restraint that Hopkins and Thompson bring to their roles , as would only be proper for those in service at the time . The juxtaposition of the unattainable romance of two downstairs people against the fading glory of the upstairs crowd is genius . Especially interesting is the fact that the author , who so manages to capture the essence of the English class structure , is an expatriate Japanese .
  148|5|Up there with the Exorcist , the Shining and all the classic psychological thrillers
14801|5|Masterful acting by Sir Anthony . He must go down as one of the greats . Low key , but always interesting . Deep , thoroughly entertaining movie .
14802|5|Emma Thompson and Sir Anthony Hopkins are so marvelous in this movie ! Until the end of the movie , you go on hoping something happen .
14803|5|Ben Kingsley probably the most evil bad guy ever in this role . . .
14804|5|good british crime drama . weird link of sexuality and violence . the acting is very understated , a lot going on under the surface , a lot of tension and power struggles . a smart , exciting film . visually very good . also a sharp sense of humor ( ever so important ) . ; )
14806|5|Great movie , but an even greater sound track .
14808|5|a great dramatic film starring some great british actors iv got the dvd and have watched iot loads of times and never got sick of it . if you like this film read junk by melvin burgess , it portrays all the difficulties of being a heroin addict as well as the pleasures you can see the donward spiral leading to being a total addict and going into rehab . similar to trainspotting .
14809|5|I was amazed at how funny and disturbing this movie was . It is one of the best movies I have ever seen , for the message it sends . For those that believe it glorifies drug use , you are CRAZY . I showed this movie to my kids in the effort to give them the best anti-drug message ( apart from Requiem for a Dream ) they will ever see . Yes , drugs feel good and we shouldn't shy away from telling our kids this or they will not trust what we tell them . The message is that the costs of those good feelings are not worth it , not at all . I was also amazed at what we in America consider to be impovershed , our standards are quite high compared to Scotland ! HUD housing in America would be considered luxurious there .
 1481|5|Brillant .
14812|5|I still can't believe over in America they had to have subtitles for this film . If you think that was a heavy Scottish accent in the film , you haven't heard my grandad ! Even I can't understand him ! Right , back to the film . The issue in the film was very contraversial when it was first released and was seen as glamourising drug use . I have never heard so much crap in my entire life ! They obviously didn't watch the film . Its very daunting , can be humourous and acted out very well . It portrays the depression of parts of society up in Scotland which also can be reflected to anywhere in the modern world . Outstanding .
14813|5|Wow ! For a twisted movie this one is really , really good . It covered many socio-topics and portrayed the cast almost magically . By the end of the film I was exhausted , having seen the lives of the people grow or die . The bathroom scene and swimming in the toilet dream will forever be burned in my mind .
14815|5|This movie really puts its finger on the pulse of the drug scene . The cinematography is awesome . One of the best soundtracks to come out in years .
14818|5|It's pretty disgusting but very good . It showed the dark side but it wasn't too much , and it wasn't like cheesy drug use movie . A good blend of everything .
14822|5|A fun , yet insightful trip into a world most of us will never encounter . Though the lives of these people seem so foreign , the moral and ethical questions they face are the same . We also see how friendships are held together and torn apart-need and greed .
14828|5|Irvin Welsh is so crazy . He wrote Trainspotting and other crazy books . He has a lot of great short stories . Trainspotting makes more and more sense the more you watch it . It is a crazy weird movie though .
14832|5|I loved this movie . It was a fair and insightful look into the very complicated issue of the death penalty .
14833|5|Hilarious movie - extremely well done . My only complaint is that I sometimes had trouble understanding what they were saying ( although it's probably my own problem - the same thing happened with The Full Monty ) .
14836|5|A sad , yet wonderful movie . Billy Bob Thornton never breaks character as mentally challenged , but pure-hearted Karl . Slingblade is serious in nature , but contains some laugh out loud moments as well .
 1484|5|The scariest of the Indiana Jones movies . the temple was real scary and the heart plucking scene , though farfetched , was cool . Also , the mine and rope bridge scenes were exciting .
14842|5|I'm much more of a baseball guy myself , and never thought that I would enjoy a movie about football . But boy was I wrong ! This movie had it all : action , drama , comedy , and great acting . I thought that it did a great job of balancing out the typical Disney atmosphere ( feel good type movies ) with the true hardships that both races had to face when integration was implemented in the 50s , 60s and 70s . I thought that this was a very touching film about acceptance , understanding and tolerance , topped off with some great music and one hell of a great cast .
14844|5|Denzel Wasington was excellent in this as always . Great story about race in the south . Especially through the eyes of youth . Entertaining , and was nice in that it didnt make the football scenes appear unrealistic like many sports movies .
14846|5|It wasn't the best done movie of 2000 ( it was well done ) , but it's real . I admit it , I fall for true feel good stories . Take two segregated schools . The white school has a great football team and a storied coach . The black school isn't quite there . Merge them . Take the black school's coach ( Denzel Washington ) and make him the head coach . Make the new school a winner . Nobody will believe it ? Well , it's real life and it's touching . See it !
14848|5|FINALLY a movie with heart ! FINALLY a decent movie . This is one of the best modern day movies made . Good directing , excellent writing , outstanding acting and decent production .
14851|5|This movie is both inspirational and proves to be another one of Denzel Washington's great performances . Based on the true story of an African-American who becomes a football coach and evokes emotion and to see through colour in his overrun white football team . It is filmed beautifully and along with the highly emotional scenes , it also has a few funny moments ( e . g . learning the white and black dislikes and likes in pairs ) . The DVD also has features explaining the meanings of certain scenes and an orray of deleted scenes . This is a truely beautifully told true story and teaches us to look beyond colour into the brave and wise words of Herman Boone .
14856|5|A great movie , one of the best I've seen this year
14858|5|This movie was awsume ! It had a great theme about how even people with different races can get along . Denzel was great in this movie as he alwayz is . it is definetly a must see !
14863|5|Good movie , I could watch it with my family and freinds . Something new now days .
14865|5|This is my favorite movie ever ! It is awesome . Denzel Washington is very good in it . So is Ryan Gosling . It's funny in some parts too .
14866|5|I was epecting a good movie . This one passed my epectations easily , The acting was superb as Denzel always is , the plot was well written . When this movie was over I wished there was more .
14873|5|What a great movie ! I thought Sissy Spacek and Hugh Wilkinson should have gotten Best Actress and Best Actor Oscars respectively , but of course the people I like never win . Hugh Wilkinson does a particlularly understated and masterful job as Sissy Spacek's husband , and film buffs might be interested to know that this amazing actor actually hails from Yorkshire , England and was in the hugely funny Full Monty . He's anything but funny in this heart-wrenching drama about a family that is devastated by the son's affair with an older woman and the catastrophic results . Sissy Spacek deserves kudos as the normally strong mother who simply cannot deal with the death of her son . This movie makes some sharp comments about America's justice system , too . Their son's murderer gets off lightly and Sissy Spacek has to endure the agony of running into him at the local grocery store . The murderer can only manage a feeble hi . Sissy Spacek's and Hugh Wilkinson's solution to this dilemma is shocking and unconventional , but one can certainly understand it . However , this movie will definitely not leave you smiling from ear to ear . Rent it if you're depressed and in the mood for a good cry .
14877|5|Great acting by everyone in the cast made this highly believable and understandable .
14880|5|In The Bedroom is one of the most powerful films of the year ! Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek are superb ! Merisa Tomei is excellent and the rest of the cast is sublime ! The storyline is a bit predictable , yetthat is not the point of the film ; this movie shows how one act of violence can tear a family to shreds . This is a very quiet and disturbing , and i litteraly mean QUIET ! There are many scenes in the film that show a character doing something with no speech . There is one disturbing scene where Spacek is sitting on the couch smoking a ciggarett and staring at the tv screen with this look of shock . its a disturbing scene ! All and all an A + movie ! Note : the film is VERY realistic , making it all that much freaky and sad .
14884|5|great fim espacilly liked the dance seen in dance hall
14885|5|I really enjoyed this movie . Mostly I enjoyed the well fleshed out characterizations . For instance , even when you really hated the father for being so abusive to Billy or the brother for being so angry , once you have a chance to know their situation you still manage to have sympathy for them . And though Billy is portrayed as a likeable kid , they didn t try to make him a perfect angel either which did nothing to turn you against him and had everything to do with making him believable . The cast was terrific from poor old grandma to Billy s friend down the street . The only thing in the movie that did not seem to ring completely true was that Billy became a star of the ballet regardless of the fact that most ballet dancers begin at around the age of 3 and Billy but did not start taking lessons until he was nearly in his teens . But I guess the whole point was that this was a prodigal who beat the odds - and in more ways than one .
14886|5|Re-educating people about gender bias . Great setting , great message !
14890|5|This may be the best movie of the year . No kidding . . . . no exageration . The reality and social butality of the strikes in northern England were brought home with first rate acting and writing that was right on . A moving totally believable story with outstanding performances by actors I had never heard of before . . . . see it .
14901|5|My favorite movie ever ! ! ! Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance as Benjamin Martin , a father of seven children , who keeps family top priority in his life . He is from South Carolina , a state which is going to war with the British . Benjamin doesn't want war ; he wishes there were some alternative to it . However , he ends up fighting the British , along with his oldest son , Gabriel , to take revenge for the death of Thomas , one of Benjamin's sons . References are made to slaves , i liked the way those conflicts were resolved in the end . Colonel Tavington got what he deserved in the end . . . I really liked that . The restoration of order taking place was great , when his house was being rebuilt . Overall , an awesome adventure and journey dealing with American History . Packed with great storylines , action and suspence . Rush out and see it .
14906|5|Powerful movie . . . not to mention the kids bearing guns part pissed the hell outta the Left .
14909|5|Its My favorite movie in my opinion one of the best made ! : ) Oh , Heath Mel are just wonderful , but its soooo sad what happens .
14910|5|In my opinion , an excellent movie . A great story . Very moving , very emotional . Jason Isaacs made the movie as great as it was for me . The other characters were good , too . Maybe not historically perfect , but still made me think about this country and how we became free . I simply loved this movie .
14911|5|Mel Gibson was great as always . I really didn't find much wrong with the movie . Actually , I couldn't see ANYTHING wrong with the movie . I didn't see any mishaps or mistakes . So , if as movie is near perfect , it deserves a five ! Heath Ledger was surprisingly good . I had only seen one movie by him . . .
14912|5|very gorey and hard to take . But a very good story . Family is a priority in this film .
14916|5|This movie was deep . A lot of spiritual insight . It's all about standing up for and preserving principles .
14921|5|This movie covered war , family and history , all things I am interested in .
14924|5|Best movie I ever saw . Everone should see it .
14925|5|I think that the patroit was one of the best movies I ever saw ! Heath Ledger looked so good in it . I guess Mel did too but I don't really know muck about him .
14926|5|great movie
14927|5|The bottom line is this , if you are a fan of Braveheart , I am confident you will enjoy this movie . If you are looking to learn something about the Revolutionary War , take a history class at your local University . The Patriot is not a documentary , nor was it advertised as such !
14928|5|What a great concept ! Hot guys , history , and a darn good plot !
14929|5|Since Braveheart this the most powerful movie i've seen in a long time . I almost believed that the actors were real people back during the Revolutionary War . They did a fantastic job , esp . Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger . Anyone who i've talked to have said that this movie was fantastic and that they cried . Even though I'm Canadian this movie is imprinted in my mind and I believe it's the closest anyone will come to understanding The Revolutionary war . I definitly believe this to be the best movie of the year .
14932|5|Reading everyones comments about the Patriot . I feel some was right and wrong about the movie . All I could say about the movie , it has spoken well . To show us all what really happen durring the war . I feel that the character Col . Travington was only doing his duty and also showing his true feelings about the war . I thought that this movie was very emotional . Sure the british soldier was wrong about burning the church with innocent folks , but who was higher in rank to stop him from burning innocent folks . So I say it was the Gerneral's fault who allow him to do what he was good at a evil valiant . But this is only a movie and I feel Jason Isaacs has perform very well and I hope he got paid good , for his work .
14934|5|I thought that the patriot was one of the best movies ive ever seen . it had all the essentials to being a great movie , too . ive tried to find it out on vhs but i can never find it . i can only find it out on dvd . well ive rented it and watched it so many times that i know every word that mel gibson is going to say . i really like the fighting scenes , also .
14937|5|Mel Gibson strikes again in another great movie . A must see .
 1494|5|This movie is great ! I've seen it like a zillion times and never tire of it . The acting is good , the little boy Shorty is adorable , and Willie , the love interst was hysterically funny .
14942|5|And just what are some of you basing your opinions of this movie being historically incorrect ? Were you all there during the events ? The importance of the movie lies not in 100 % accuracy , but in the real story of a young Nations' fight for independence . It shows the heart and soul of the men and women who sacrificed everything so you could live free today . With all the crap being generated in Hollywood today , nothing more than eye candy , it was nice to be treated to an interactive experience , where what was being said was as important as what was being done . Any American , with a sense of pride in their Country , will be able to watch this movie and be proud of their heritage .
14943|5|The Patriot is the best movie i have ever seen . There was so much action . it had different genres of movies all in one . it had drama , action and comedy . This movie deserves a five star rating ! I loved it sooooo much , and can't wait to buy it !
14946|5|I think that The patriot is one of the greatest all-times movie ! It was excellent ! The acting was great ( both from Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger ) ! The historical accuracy might not be at its best but it does not really matter . The movie does reflect a bit of the I single-handedly saved the world theme that so many American movies have about them , but it was still very good . If I could I would have given it six stars !
14948|5|Mel Gibson , what can I say ? It is definitely one of the best summer movies with a great plot , acting , and smooth transitions between scenes . The only complaint I had about this movie is that it is too much like Braveheart .
14949|5|Best movie I have ever seen . Absolutly love it !
14950|5|This movie was great--a perfect balance between gory violence and healthy patriotism . Restraint was an interesting idea for a theme . And I'm glad Mel didn't have any . Most importantly , though , was how this movie was neither a fraud nor a sham . A definite plus .
14953|5|You can tell Mel Gibson has children in real life . . He was very moving in this film-we are lucky to have him as an actor in our generation . Who was the boy that played the older son ? A star to watch , I believe .
14954|5|This movie was I think the best movie that Mel Gibson has ever played a role in . He was fantastic . This movie made me look at our country's history of war in a different prospective . Although it may have been a movie , it made me realize how it was for the men fighting for our country's freedom . It really brought tears to my eyes and I celebrated the 4th of July in a whole different light this year !
14955|5|I enjoyed watching the Patriot . I didn't think Mel Gibson could be as successful with the Patriot as he was with Braveheart but I was wrong . They are both equally good movies .
14957|5|Patriot is a fantastic movie . Great story , great costumes , a lot of action . The action is not too realistic , which is rare these days .
14960|5|What a great movie ! ! ! I give it 5 stars without a doubt . If I could , I even wanna give more than 5 stars . I love the movie itself , actors ( chemistry between veteran Mel Gibson and new-comer Heath Ledger's are sooooo good ) , soundtrack ! I've seen the movie three times and I can't wait till it comes on vhs or dvd .
14962|5|I didn't really know what to expect going in , and the three hour running time made me a bit weary , but I definitely thought it was worth it . The story line was extremely interesting , and I enjoyed the historical aspect of it . The acting was also very good , and I would want to see future movies starring these actors .
14965|5|Mel Gibson still has it . He is inspirational , moving , and emotional all at the same time .
14968|5|Anonymous ( The fraud one ) must be a British Subject . While this movie is a compilation of multiple stories from the Revolution , it has a good historical base . A very heart ripping movie , that should motivate any American to be proud of our forefathers . As a devout Constitutionalist , I found the scenes regarding the Militia and firearms ownership and use to be exceptional . A must see movie .
 1497|5|Like all the other Indiana Jones movies , this one was great . It's fun , scary and has a lot of action and suspense , although all those Jones movies are great . This one is my favorite for the dining scene and loads of bugs .
14974|5|Best movie I have seen since Titanic . Should be required for all young people to get a brief understanding of the sacrifices made by the people who founded this country . I applaud Mel Gibson for making a film with such strong conservative values .
14977|5|Wonderful film filled with thoughtful quality performances . Very depressing . Weren't the people who played Hillary Swank's family members completely convincing as poor white trailer trash ?
14978|5|I finally got around to seeing this movie , and man , it's tough to watch . The whole time , you know where the movie is headed , but you still can't prepare yourself for the emotional wallop when it happens . Hilary Swank is one of the best actors out there - she plays the tough trailer park girl perfectly , and Clint Eastwood is at his understated best . Morgan Freeman plays exactly the same role he did in Shawshank Redemption , and again it works for him . But I think the story is what makes this movie work . Inspiration followed by devastation . Would be curious as to what foes of euthanasia have to say about this one .
14980|5|Heart breaking . The mother daughter dynamic was tough to swallow . Perfectly acted by the main cast and told in an unrushed and sincere manner befitting the story .
14981|5|If you don't know it WE ARE AT SCHOOL , then how can you rate it ? Idiot This was a solid movie , with a good story .
14988|5|A wonderful film . Jamie Foxx showed me more of that special something I saw in ( don't laugh ) Any Given Sunday . Foxx literally becomes Charles for this film-taking on the mannerisms , carriage and voice of Ray . The movie showed the genius as well as the tragedy of this very human talent . I was particularly moved by the portrayal of his mother . A woman who you would expect to resent her son ( s ) ( 1 . raising two young boys on menial labor , 2 . as a stunned child Ray stood by as his younger brother , drowned , 3 . Ray becomes blind and a heavier burden within the year of his brother's death ) , instead his mother never lays blame at Ray's feet , loves him in a strong brave way and sacrifices by sending the last child she has away ( this must have broken her heart ) to attend a school where he might learn enough to become someone . The movie's epiphany is where Ray's mother ( in dream / fantasy sequence ) tells Ray that , for all his genius and success , he has failed in his promise to her by becoming an addict . A wonderful message about motherhood .
14989|5|Jamie Foxx is terrific as Ray Charles . I really did forget he was an actor portraying Ray Charles . Very well done movie it took Ray Charles life until the mid 60s . I liked that it was honest and showed his talent along with his flaws . Very entertaining movie . and we get to hear some of Ray Charles music .
 1499|5|Eating the fried monkey brains , eyeball soup , the hallway with bugs , and the beating heart . These scences are all time bests of the Temple of Doom . It was really good and I can watch it over and over .
14990|5|A great documentary . The length of the movie was appropriate .
14991|5|Absolutly amazing .
14992|5|Jamie Foxx's finest hour . He deserves an Oscar nomination and an Oscar .
14993|5|I read a review of this movie that said you forget you're watching someone play Ray Charles , and it couldn't be more true . Jamie Foxx was incredible . And you probably couldn't find a more interesting life to make a movie about .
14994|5|Awesome performance by Jaime Foxx . Worthy movie to the legacy of Ray Charles .
14997|5|This movie kept me interested the entire time . It was mind boggling how a guy can evade police for so long and take on so many identities . I thought this movie deserved five stars because it kept me intrigued . Not many movies can do that for me . And DiCapprio wasn't bad either ; he's always been a hottie .
15002|5|My favorite movie of the year . It was a bit long , but I really liked it . It's the kind of movie you want to buy on video or DVD . I just got mine ! Watch this movie ; you won't regret it .
15008|5|Catch me if you can was a very cool story . I thought it was very enjoyable with well developed characters .
15013|5|I just loved this movie . I went in expecting to see an ok movie , but it is really entertaining ! Dicaprio is perfect for the part of frank abignale , the con man , as is Tom Hanks in his role as the FBI agent . really a great see .
15017|5|I watched this movie again and I really fell in love with the character Daisy Randone . She is just a giant intriguing mystery . She's a well done character who's finally found out . Her death scene made me cry so hard . Brittany Murphy deserved an oscar nomination for this role .
15018|5|This was an outstanding movie ! Angelina Jolie's performance was indescribable ! This was a true story about an 18 year old girl , Susanna Kaysen ( played by Winona Ryder ) , who was accused of being insane and put into a mental institute . She meets many girls with problems far worse than hers , for example , Lisa ( Angelina Jolie ) . There is no movie better than this one , and I can say that with honest truth . If you've read the book the movie might ruin some assumptions you made during your reading , or clear up some fuzzy areas . It's my favorite movie ever !
 1502|5|Without a doubt a five star movie based on a four-star graphic-novel . Yes , that's a big thick comic book . Brandon Lee had just reached stardom after the movie Rapid Fire and then was taken from us during the filming of The Crow . At least he left his mark with it . Great move , killer soundtrack .
15026|5|This is an awsome movie and one of my favorites . The cast was very beleivable . I think the blandness of Ryders character in the movie was meant to be that way in order to compliment Jolies wildness . Of course it was a little different than the book . Movies aren't as clear because they're not so black and white as books . That's the coolest part about the movie . We can see it differently . I don't believe these girls were as crazy as they wanted us to believe they were . I think more that they were just women who didn't want to follow the rules of the outside world . Maybe even the outside world would like to be as carefree as these women are sometimes but , we're afraid people will think we're crazy . I give the movie a 5 star rating because it's as realistic and crazy as this world we're living in .
15027|5|In the movie girl interrupted . the movie was great . I saw that lisa is more like me in some ways and that what I want is for someone to tell me the truth , to care enough about me to tell me what everyone knows but is afraid to say .
15028|5|I this was really good , especially Angelina Jolie .
15034|5|i thought the movie was the best ! i think its like one of those girl movies though . my brother wasnt to into it . but me and my best friend could watch that movie a million times !
15035|5|This movie was excellent . U realize that some people who have commented on it think otherwise , however it is due in part because they have no clear understanding of what a borderline really is . Who cares if Wyonna Ryder was in the movie , the fact that someone played the role of Susanna Kaysen . . was all that mattered . . . and that she was evaluated and treated . . . Susanna was one of the lucky ones . . . she could be helped and she could go on to live a normal healthy life until some of the others , , , , We must never critized that which we do not understand . . . Mental Illness happens everyday . . . and we do not have the right to make light of it . . instead we should perhaps take a closer look and try to understand the plight of those trapped inside themselves . . .
15040|5|I found this movie phenomenal on all levels . The cast had excellent chemistry and amazing talent . The script was a beautiful mix of poetry , humor , drama and plain insanity . I think many were able to associate with the characters on one level or another , especially reaching out to teens , who can often find commonalities with the main character and perhaps the others as well .
15041|5|This movie was fabulous . The message it sent was very deep . Are we all really crazy ? Or is it the world that is so crazy ? ? The character Lisa by far was the best in the movie . After watching this movie I'm always taken aback . Its like I'm actually living it . I love it ! ! 5 + + + + +
15043|5|I thought this film did an excellent job of connecting the viewer with the actors . It left me emotional . It kept me involved . I wanted to really meet the characters and help fix them .
15046|5|Girl , Interrupted is based upon a true story written by Susanna Kaysen ( played by Winona Ryder ) , who is falsely accused of being crazy . Placed in a mental institution , she is confroted with the desicion of her life . She must decide on whether she wants to get better , or to spend her life being insane . The only thing standing in her way is the controlling , sociopath , Lisa ( played by Angelina Jolie . ) Director , James Mangold , has been critisized for the movies flat plotline , and inability to transfer the book into a movie . I agree that the films plot took a different route than most flicks , but to say it had no plot at all is an understatement . Those that say it had no plot , probably didn't understand it . With Ryder co-producing and starring in the flick , how can it go wrong ? Not to mention other incredible performances by Angelina Jolie , Whoopie Goldberg , Brittany Murphy , Clea Duvall , and many more . Lets face it , we all can relate to feeling a little crazy sometimes . . okay , maybe not as crazy as some of the characters eating grapes off of the wallpaper , but crazy in some sense . This movie is a MUST-SEE , and definetly deserves this 5 star rating ! ! Copyrighted 2000 Kris10 R . Lee
15048|5|I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've EVER seen ! I think that I love it so much b / c I kould relate to the situation so well . Excellent acting too !
15050|5|this was the best movie i have seen in months , it goes into my top 5 list , it made me feel alive
15055|5|Girl Interrupted is my favorite movie . Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie were excellent . I related to this movie in everyway . The plot was easy to follow and the ending was predictable . After watching it , it made me question my reality and ask myself , am I crazy ?
15057|5|How in the world the Golden Globes could have paid homage to American Beauty and not Girl , Interrupted and to Winona is beyond me . This was a touching film filled with interesting characters --- its was positive despite the harsh topics it presented .
15060|5|Brilliant . Anyone who can't take their Warren Commission blinders off after watching this film just REFUSES to get it .
15062|5|Oliver Stone presents a great case . If there was no conspiracy then why is the evidence set to be released in 25 years ? The warren commision is a joke and this movie shows that .
15064|5|JFK is one of the most compeling dramas I have ever seen . Oliver stone did an AMAZING job with this film as he does with every other movie he does . Probably the Biggest amount of tallented actors I have ever seen : to name a few Kevin Costern , Tommy Lee Jones , Kevin Bacon , Joe Pesci , Sissy Spacek , Jack Lemmon , John Candy , and Gary Oldman . The movie has so much info and takes you Right in the middle of Jim Garrison's investigation ; absolutly enthralling .
15065|5|This is probably one of the most compelling dramas that I have watched in my lifetime . Everything about the movie seemed to be up to the par : the acting , the script , the dialogue , the directing and the musical score . Critics of this film like to pander on the fact that it is not entirely accurate . Well , no , it is not . But then again , neither was the Warren Report that concluded that Oswald acted alone in the assassination , despite the fact that a Congressional Investigation in the late 70s suspected otherwise , stating that John F . Kennedy was probably killed by a conspiracy . Even if you are one of those who believe the findings of the Warren Commission , I would hope that you would recognize this film's greatness . Kevin Costner's final speech to the jury towards the end of the movie was simple , to the point , and one of the best that I have seen ( better than Nicholson's in A Few Good Men . ) . JFK is made up of an all-star cast with Kevin Bacon , Kevin Costner , Tommy Lee Joens , Joe Pesci and Gary Oldman all at their best . This movie is merely that , a movie . It is not meant to be based on facts , but meant to reflect the opinions of Oliver Stone , Jim Garrison and others . I don't believe some of the things suggested in this film ( LBJ's complicity among them ) , but I still think that it was a very well done fllm . It is a very important film because it is the first Hollywood filmt to at least explore the possibility of a conspiracy in the Kennedy death , and despite many of the film's factual errors , many of its points cannot be denied ( i . e . The Warren Commission was a very sloppy investigation ) . John Williams' score for this film is perfectly suited , and his apparent passion for Kennedy and his assassination is very obvious . The score for JFK made the movie even more compelling , espescially in the beginning when switching from a somewhat Cassandra-like theme to a drum roll , implying a military connection . The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers in order to discover the truth about one of the most controversial and historically important events ever . I reccomend this to anyone who is interested in the Kennedy assassination , or anyone who is in the mood for a thought-compelling drama .
 1507|5|I found this movie enjoyable , pity what happened to brandon lee .
15076|5|Excellent re-enactment of what really occurred within the time period . The timeline was accurate and the actors were great . Kevin Costner was also a great lawyer and investigator .
15082|5|good movie
15084|5|I like the way they filmed it , it looked like an amature movie . Del Toro is awsome ! good storyline !
15085|5|A winner . Traffic is not for the faint of heart . You'll be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end as the story unfolds . Who's a good guy ? WHo's a bad guy ? Who can you trust ? Will we ever see a Supporting Actor do a better job than Benicio Del Toro ? Who dangerous is the drug trade ? Who's shielded from it ? If you've ever been a user , you should see this movie . If you've ever known a user , you should see this movie . If you've ever had a child , or think you might ever have a child , you should see this movie . And , make sure you know who you can trust .
 1509|5|I think this movie is the greatest movie of all time . I saw it when I was 10 and fell in love with it . It shows a guy and his girlfriend get brutally murdered by greasy thugs . Eric Draven gets his revenge all of of them when the crow brings him back . I also believe that if Brandon Lee's life hadn't been cut short he would have been a huge star . RIP Brandon
15093|5|Perhaps one of the best movies of our recent movie times . The acting , directing , and overall production of this movie are superb -interlacing several stark stories surrounding drugs in our society . At times you forget you are watching a movie it becomes so real . A must see for everyone .
15097|5|Traffic was amazing ! ! ! ! ! The peoplw who you thought couldn't act , SURPRISE , they can . Michael Douglas is my hero . I loved this movie it was pure genious . And anyone who trys to compare this movie to The General's Daughter , will have to deal with me . If you havent seen it go see it . I am in love with Traffic .
15099|5|What a powerful movie . Believe me , this is not a feel good movie . But it is a remarkably well-done film that makes you think . With his variety of camera angles and use of light , director Steven Soderbergh did a tremendous job putting this film together . And the ensemble cast was great , as well . Particularly impressive to me were the performances by Benicio del Toro as the Mexican cop and the girl who played Michael Douglass' daughter . All in all , I highly recommend this film to get an inside look at how drugs impact lives in the ways that you may not immediately realize . Though not for everyone , Traffic will at worst give you something to think about .
  151|5|This movie should be a classic ! Not only is it scary , it is intellectual as well . The audience is lead throughout the movie with the use of psychological fear . Not to mention the award winning acting performances .
 1510|5|Based on the graphic novel by James O'Barr with the same title . The film really lived up to the graphic novel and its brilliant to watch with all the gothic imagery and simplistic camera work . The premise of the film is simple - if a love is pure it will never die which is reflected when Eric Draven ( Brandon Lee ) returns from the dead one year after his and his fiancees deaths on devils night . Eric seeks revenge on the persons responsible for their deaths and one by one kills off the criminals by their own trademark which leads up to a fantastic sequence between him and the big boss who ordered the deaths . It was tragic that this was Brandon Lee's last film - but that makes it even more special to watch as you get to see him in a spectacular film .
15101|5|For me , Traffic is going to be my pick for the best film of not only the year , but the decade . Stephen Soderbergh took a large risk in making a film with a budget , with stars , and a RELEVANT story line , and to agree with another film critic , it is the best drama Hollywood has put out since The Godfather in 1972 . The acting was superb , the photography ( which Soderbergh shot under a pseudonym ) was brilliantly shaky and colorful , and the plot was so wonderfully complex without going over the top that it is too much to explain here and do it justice . Benicio Del Toro and Michael Douglas are the real standouts in this picture , though nearly all other characters are just as complicated and lived in . Soderbergh , even before Traffic was released , was my favorite living director , and with this brilliant epic , he will surely become the same for others . For those who liked Traffic , I also recommend Soderbergh's cut and paste noir The Limey which used many of the same techniques , and it also featured the always lovable Luis Guzman , who in Traffic served with Don Cheadle as the comic relief , a witty live action Puumba of their silly duo . I loved it , every frame .
15102|5|Th drug problem is everywhere and the sooner we regulate it the less the violence and crime . Erdaicating it will not deter the growth of the product or problem . A must see for all ages . Gets your head out of the sand and makes you face some stark realities .
15108|5|The camera work in combination with a thrilling and totally on key soundtrack only enhance a seemingly flawless plot . Best $ 8 I have spent in a while . This movie is capable of evoking emotions commonly no associated with movies of its pace , action , and big name star caliber . However , Michael Douglas , Salma Hayek , and Catherine Zeta Jones team up to really make a memorable movie .
15109|5|Great movie that mixes drama and comedy . A movie where in one weekend 4 people begin to find their true selves . Very well written and in some places very funny . Michael Douglas gives one of the best performance of his career as Professor Grady Tripp . Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey Jr who are two of the best actors of their generations give terrific performances .
 1511|5|ok for some reason i just looove this movie . the action is awesome and the story lines i think are touching . it has something for guys and girls : )
15111|5|Highly entertaining , very funny . One of Michael Douglas' best performances , at least since Wall Street . Very well written !
15112|5|quite possibly one of my favorite movies of all time . all the elements are there : first rate acting from the whole cast , great storyline adapted from an amazing novel , michael douglas at his humble best , and if you can believe it--and honest portrayal or modesty , redemption , lost talent , rivalry , and above all else--an honest portrayal of the heart it takes to be a writer .
15117|5|We rented this movie last night . Definitely one of the better films I have seen in quite a while . I am surprised it didn't get more media attention . . at least not that I remember . Douglas , Maguire , McDormand and Downey Jr . all did an amazing job in forming their characters and drawing in the audience . I disagree with Molfan , I found this film very humorous . . maybe because I enjoy dark , dry humor . . You couldn't help but laugh at the comedic tragedy of this weekend in the life of this group of people . I am not for killing dogs . . but the whole scenario was humorous in a sick way . . I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone . As for the ending . . I enjoyed the fact that they gave some closure . . however , in sticking with the unpredictable plot , they could have ended with him wavering at the top of the stairs . . keep you wondering . . of course , that may have irritated a lot of people . . thus the nice happy ending . GREAT MOVIE !
 1512|5|The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life . I have seen it over 1000 times ( went through 2 vhs copies before I got my dvd ) . There isn't enough good things I can say about this movie . Instead , I just make people watch it , and I've yet to hear a complaint . I have the scenes , script , soundtrack , and score memorized . It's just such a powerful movie . I've yet to have such a cathartic response with another film as I've had with 'The Crow' . Romantic , violent , wry , heart-wrenching , satisying . . . one of the greatest films ever made , in my opinion .
15121|5|best performance of Douglas' career . enough said . poor omr . downey jr .
15123|5|This movie is fantastic . One of the best movies of the year . You will be inspired by the characters and story . Toby Mcguire is fantastic as the slightly crazy writing student . It will make you want to change your life .
15125|5|This is a funny movie that does go into both personal relationships and career issues . Interesting look into the politics in America , colleges , and universities . I enjoyed the aspect of a writer unable to stop writing his second book .
15126|5|This movie just kind of came and went , and nobody seems to have talked about it much . I'm surprised , because it was one of the more original and entertaining movies I've seen since American Beauty . I'm not saying it was a ground-breaking motion picture by any means , but the characters had depth , the story wasn't predictable , and the quality of the acting was high . I'll tell you what - if you didn't see it in the theater , and one night you're in the mood for a good , quirky rental , Wonder Boys is a great call .
15127|5|Very cool . About our relationship with our work and our need for self-discipline in it . Also entertaining .
15128|5|Realistic and bizarre at once . Good characters , not normal Hollywood types .
 1513|5|this movie was very ahead of its time and is still a good movie today . probably the most justified violence of any movie
15130|5|A very well crafted and very enjoyable movie . Unlike a lot of surprise ending movies , this does not lose its appeal on repeat viewings .
15131|5|I absolutely loved this movie and Paul Newman .
15134|5|This is one of my favourite Meryl Streep films and boasted a stellar cast . Although the movies subject matter of divorce is depressing Robert Benton and Avery Corman manage to find a balance with the screenplay and novel as to why the mother walked out on her son and how the father manages to cope as a single parent . What I loved about Meryl's performance as Joanna Kramer is that she un-doubtedly did something wrong , but funnily enough I sympathised with her character succumbing to her role as a young mother and wife . Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as Ted Kramer and a very young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer was a complete natural . This film managed to encompass a complicated and somewhat delicate issue of its time .
15136|5|Tremendous flick . Just love it .
15137|5|Very well done movie . Dustin Hoffman is a dad who is very busy with his career he is thrown a curveball when his wife leaves to find herself and is left to take care of his six year old son Billy . What i love about this movie is the dad has to change his priorities and make Billy the most important , All the actors are good . After about 18 months mom comes back and wants to have Billy back there is a bitter custody battle . The very ending is a tearjerker that shows what sacrifice and love is for a child .
15138|5|Munson , I certainly agree with you . Kramer vs . Kramer is a wonderfully touching film , and Justin Henry as the seven year old involved in a custody battle , is brilliant . I think this is one of Hoffman's best films as well . The way his and Meryl Streep's characters are shown as mostly vindictive toward the other , but with an underlying compassion as well as thinking of the child , adds substance to the story . I applaud Kramer vs . Kramer for depicting divorce through a child's eyes so well , that surely even the more hardened of hearts will be affected by it . The best motion pictures do more than merely entertain ; they enlighten . Bravo !
 1514|5|A wonderful action film that mixes both drama and comedy . The death of Brandon Lee was so tragic , and I think that the success of this movie is a wonderful tribute to an actor whose career was cut way too short .
15140|5|A true commentary on the duality of the sexes . Just Brilliant !
15141|5|The Piano is a very haunting film . The story line is so moving and original , that it is a triumph ! The acting is first rate , and the art directing , musical score and directing from Jane Campion is a thing of beauty ! For anyone that complains that hollywood doesn't make good films anymore , you should see this !
15142|5|My favorite film of all time . And it's as timely now as ever ( just turn on your TV in 2004 ! ) Great acting , great screenplay--everything just clicks . The entire cast was in peak form .
15143|5|Depp ( and Pacino ) were excellent ; best cops and robbers movie since 'Goodfellas' .
15146|5|Brilliant movie . It shows what a discipline can do . We need more Coach's like Coach Carter in our high schools and colleges . A few in the workplace would not be a bad idea either ! !
15149|5|WOW ! This movie is my all time favorite movie . It contained everything a good movie should . Emotion , comedy , and romance . I would reccomend this movie to ANYONE ! ! because it is the best ever !
 1515|5|A tragic story of a man who returns from the grave to avenge the deaths of his fiancee ` as well as himself . This is a movie for people that enjoy movies with a dark atmosphere and violent storyline .
15150|5|That movie was hilarious . You gotta love the little kid .
15153|5|cruise and crowe could become the stewart / capra of their generation .
15155|5|I have to give this movie a five because I think Cameron Crowe has such a talent for portraying reality with such entertainment . I really appreciate Crowe's dedication to character development ( something often sorely lacking in today's movies ) , his meticulous attention to casting actors that fit the part , and overall his natural talent for depth . With most movies , there's the hero , who's usually flawless for the most part , the supporting characters and the villains . Usually I'll only like / appreciate one or two of them , but in Jerry Maguire I just fell in love with everybody .
15166|5|I enjoyed the plot of this movie because it didn't involve sports only . It incorporated family values . It showed a different aspect of professional players along with agents .
15168|5|the best romace i had seen in a while .
15169|5|I gave Jerry Maguire a 5 because it's such a great movie . Tom Cruise does so well in it . He is such a great actor . Also the plot of the movie is good because it is based on true life events . It also has a really good storyline .
 1517|5|This was a very likeable buddy movie . The two partners are good foils for each other .
15173|5|An exceptional love story and powerful portrayal of resisting the standards set forth by corporate America . The acting was great . I thought the character played by Gooding was phenomenal . All the roles were played with depth and conviction .
15175|5|I really enjoyed watching this movie because I liked the storyline . I also think that Tom Cruise did a very good job . Also I think that little boy was very cute .
 1518|5|i love these movies . gibson and glover are perfectly paired . alot of action with a little humor makes them fun to watch
15182|5|Jerry McGuire inspires people to do the right thing and to stick with your instincts . Also a great love story
15186|5|A movie where the characters take central focus . Viewers don't even have to know , care or like horses or horse races . Seabiscuit and his jockey Red Pollard are both down and out angry souls . Tobey Maguire is excellent as Red Pollard as he portrays his hurt , anger and pride . The horse and the jockey understand each other and it shows . Jeff Bridges is superb as Charles Howard , the man who takes Pollard in and never gives up on both of them . The real stand out is Chris Cooper as the reticent horse trainer Tom Smith . The horse racing scenes are wonderful , but the movie does right to focus on the lives and interaction of the three men . It is a great movie of perserverence .
15191|5|A fine family film if there ever was one . I didn't realize that Seabiscuit was as popular as he was until I saw this film . It not only leaves you with a good feeling at the end of the movie , it also leaves you wanting to know more about him . I went directly after the movie and bought Laura Hillenbrand's book on which the film was based just so I could read the complete story . I highly recommend everyone go see this , even if you're not a horse fan .
15192|5|Loved it was great
15194|5|Wonderfully done ! Very engaging movie !
15197|5|Great story and great actors . It has a lot of heart . I hope to see Bridges and Cooper up for Oscars .
 1520|5|The whole series is good , but part one is the best .
15201|5|This movies portrays a quintesential role for Kevin Spacey as he plays a broken man seeking a new life and to mend his heart . It is a great story and the scenery they filmed in Newfoundland really captured imagination and the Old Salt characters really made this movie unique .
15203|5|Hoo-ah ! ! !
15204|5|Since I'm towards the other end of the generation scale , I origionally only saw this movie to see what Chris O'Donnell did before Batman and Circle Of Friends . As usual I was impressed by his peformance but I was pleasently suprised by Al Pacino who is way before my time . I loved this movie and it has taught me to appreciate the effort of older actors rather than all the teen flicks I'm used too .
15205|5|Pacino is the man . Al definitely makes the movie . I also really liked the story .
15206|5|Al Pacino is one of my all time favorite actors . He is extremely talented and versatile . Chris O'Donnell is also spectacular as a new comer to Hollywood when the movie first came out .
15207|5|Al Pacino gave a great performance . His character was real lovable but you had to get used to him first . He taught that kid a lot about character . I almost cried when he came to the defense for his friend at the trial . I was happy that the kid got out of trouble with the help of his friend . This was a good drama . Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors .
15208|5|One of the best movies of all time . A true human interest film . Excellent story and easy to follow . The ending rivals that of any movie . Al Pacino gives an awesome performance worthy of an Oscar .
15219|5|Incredible man , great movie , a test of endurance that will never be seen again . . . . . . .
15220|5|For people that don't know about this amazing story of human survival and willpower , go see this movie . It's the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton and his voyage to cross Antarctica on foot . It is the most incredible story that you have ever heard and shopws the true meaning of courage , willpower , and survival .
15222|5|Love this movie . It's a great love story , and a good family movie .
15224|5|I loved this movie . It's better than the original Cinderella story , much more real . The characters come to life . Drew Barrymore is an excellent Cinderella . She's not one of those toothpick thin girls but a real woman-she has a shape and shows it . The costumes were wonderful and Anjelica Huston as the step-mother was great ! A good find for the entire family to watch on a cold winter's night or afternoon when school's canceled .
15225|5|Loved it , loved it , loved it , need I say more one of my all- time favorite movies . Drew Barrymore was so cute in it . It was romantic and cool and a way better version of the classic Cinderella story . It seems more real . Gotta love it .
15226|5|I love this movie ! It was so entertaining and Drew Barrymore is so cute .
15228|5|fun movie . Kids can watch .
 1523|5|Lethal Weapon has great action scenes , great dialogue , and better acting than you'll find in most action movies . It combined drama and action perfectly , and we can truly get inside the character's heads and understand their emotions . Mel Gibson at his best-crazy as a leper .
15233|5|One of Pacino's all time classic permormances . A simple film set largley on location , ie the bank , the film which could have ended up turgid and monotonous due to its long periods of inactivity and its very simplicity ends up vibrant and gripping due soley to an all time great performance by pacino . The phone call sceans act as a kinda microcosm of the film . The camera zooms in on Pacino , escaping the madness of the crowd outside and the media hoopla as Sonny talks to his two wives . Again , had we been watching a lesser actor the sceane would have dragged and been extruciatingly dull . As it turns out Pacino makes the sceans among the greatest moments in cinama history , IMO . Acting masterclass .
15234|5|This is an absolutely fantastic film that was made in 1975 . it stars Al Pacino as the main character Sonny - he's trying to rob a bank helped by his friend Sal in order to pay for his male lovers sex change . He had everything planned out ( or so he thought ) until he finds out that the money had already been removed before he had got there . So he decides to hold the bank clerks and manager hostage and the situation becomes desperate . The local police , led by Sergeant Moretti ( Charles Dunning ) try to get the situation under control , but because of Sonny's charisma , the general public who are outside support Sonny and the whole thing becomes a media circus . You do feel yourself willing Sonny and Sal to be ok and to live happily ever after , especially when Sonny's wife and male lover become involved and you think they are going to get away with it . But it ends so tragically . This is a timeless film and really shows Al Pacino's magnificance as an actor and the script is amazing . If you are a fan of Al Pacino and you haven't seen this , I urge you to .
15237|5|One of the best films of all time . Great acting . Jack Nicholson was great .
 1524|5|I love all the Lethal Weapon films and although this one is not my favorite of the series , I still thought that is was a great film . It combined drama and action perfectly , and we can truly get inside the character's heads and understand their emotions . Mel Gibson does a wonderful job of portraying Riggs's eccentric , somewhat troubled personality to the audience . Danny Glover is perfectly cast as the grouchy Murtaugh who has his own insecurities about his age . The chemistry that Glover and Gibson share is simply amazing and it really perfected the film . And boy , what a creepy performance by Gary Busey . Then again , I guess it's not hard for him to take on creepy roles . In the final analysis , Lethal Weapon is definately one worth watching , and be sure to catch the rest of the films as well .
15241|5|I loved this movie because it was so emotional and I cried at the end
15244|5|One of the best comedies of all time .
15245|5|Robin Williams is so good ! this is funny and emotional , good combination .
15248|5|Good Morning Vietnam is a really good movie . Robin Williams does a really good job . I personally enjoy war movies , even though I don't enjoy war . It's kind of nice to see the truth and realize what really goes on . Robin Williams is also a great comedian .
15253|5|I felt so bad for this poor guy ( Szpilman ) ! Adrien Brody did an excellent job . Roman Polanski painted a very vivid and disturbing picture of what WWII was like . A great movie . . .
15254|5|Wow . I've seen this movie twice , but it never ceases to captivate me . I cry with him , I feel his hunger and his loss , I realize his fear . Adrien Brody was simply incredible in this role -- I can think of no one who could have done it better . One of the most powerful scenes is when he is walking down the street crying and there are hundreds of suitcases and belongings strewn on the sidewalks and in the road . I also like the fact that a German soldier is portrayed in a favorable light -- he helped Wladyslaw when things weren't looking so good . He also spared Wladyslaw's life ( and in real life , the lives of other Jews ) but was still imprisoned by the Russians after the surrender in Europe and subsequently died in a POW camp years later . So tragic , and so unjust .
15256|5|There are some movies like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back that lower your opinion of humanity and there are others like Forrest Gump that can raise it . The beauty of The Pianist is that it can do both . Though this is a holocaust film , there are no concentration camps and it is all seen through the eyes of one man with long periods without dialogue . Much has been said about whether Adrien Brody underacted the part or not . I think he did a beautiful job and far from seeming detached from it all , he seemed more shocked and numb to me . If I had to endure what he endured I would probably mentally shut down too . The first part of the film was very hard for me . I had a hard time with Schindler's List and a few scenes in this movie proved very difficult and I'll admit I cried through most of the first half . After Szpilman loses his family , but has his own life spared , he goes on mental auto-pilot and just does what he can to get by . The last half-hour is very moving and makes all the violent scenes near the beginning worthwhile . The thing about this film is that it can do wonders for putting your life into perpective , if even for just a few days . After seeing this film , I realize just how petty most of our problems are in this society and how much we take our civil liberties for granted . Aside from being a beautifully made film , The Pianist sends a powerful message of just how much we have to be thankful for .
15258|5|The best movie of the year . Near-perfect . Polanski's best since Chinatown .
15259|5|Not mean to be a documentary , The Pianist follows the story of a Warsaw survivor . Excellent , excellent , excellent . Brody works magic on the screen .
 1526|5|This was a great movie . The sequals were even really good . I love Mel Gibson so that helped , but it was a great action flick along with a little comedy and suspense . It had an amazing story line also .
15260|5|best biopic of the year and return to form for Polanski Hope it wins something on Oscar night . Moving yet chilling Incredible !
15262|5|The best film of 2002 bar none .
15267|5|Good movie . About boxer Rubin Hurricane Carter . an african American who faces racial prejudice and injustice . He ends up in Juvenille detention for protecting a friend against a predator . He goes on to be a boxer and is known as the Hurricane . a few years later he is wrongly accused of murder set up by a dishonest , racist , police detective . He spends the next 20 years in jail . In jail he writes a book about his life , which is read years later by a young black youth . He along with his friends make it their mission to get Rubin out of jail . At the end Rubin is given tne justice he deserves and gets out of jail . This movie shows how hatred can destroy lives and how there are still people out their who are willing ti fight injustice . Denzel Washington is great as Rubin Carter .
15275|5|Damn ! This was a great , inspirational movie . I loved it . Great acting , major props to Denzel .
15276|5|Hurricane rocked ! No joke ! That was the single most inspiring movie I have ever watched . I watched it over and over again now that it is on cable . The acting was great and the story was true .
15279|5|I like most movies but love very few . The Hurricane is in an elite catagory in my mind . It was a great story ( mostly true ) , it was great acting and it had some boxing in it . It also made viewers think in a different mind set than usual at convicted felons .
15280|5|This was an excellent movie in all aspects . All of the actors especially Denzel Washington ( who should have won the academy award for Best Lead Actor ) did a tremendous job of bringing the story of Robin Hurrican Carter to life . It was a great dramatic film .
15282|5|A true moving picture that depicts the adversity the black culture had to go through . Denzel Washington was amazing in this film and portrays his character with total passion .
15287|5|Very good movie that exposed injustices in the U . S . court system . The racism of sentecing an innocent man to death to cover up police and mob connections .
15288|5|Another outstanding performance by Danzel Washington , oscar should have been his this year .
 1529|5|This was a great movie as well . Mel Gibson and Danny Glover play off each other so well . The director did a good job of molding comedy and action into a movie .
15290|5|I saw The Green Mile two weeks ago and thought this was the best movie I have seen since Saving Private Ryan . Then I saw Hurricane and I had a new most recent Favorite . If Denzel does not get an Oscar for this it would be a travesty . Just as Ruben Hurricane Carter's book acted as the catalyst for his freedom and this movie , his movie has inspired me to read his book and learn more about his amazing life .
15294|5|I was amazingly surprised with this story . it's about a bachlor ( Hugh Grant ) who hates kids , and ins up getting stuck with one . He changes the life of this kid an though he doesn't know , the boy beggins to change his . a very emotional but satisfying movie I give it five * * * * * . ( PG-13 for thematic elements some sexual refferences and Language , including two F-Bombs ) .
15298|5|I'm giving About a Boy five stars simply because watching it was such an enjoyable experience . The movie is about a swinging bachelor ( played by Hugh Grant ) who becomes involved in a young boy's life and , as a result , learns to see life in a different way . The movie was sweet without being saccharine , and it was filled with funny scenes . Hugh Grant , an actor I usually avoid , was outstanding in his role . In fact , he and Nicholas Hoult ( who played the young boy ) made the movie . If you're in the mood for a nice story , some good humor , and excellent acting , check out About a Boy .
  153|5|This was an amazing movie . Anthony Hopkins was outstanding ! This movie scared me from the beginning to the end . I was shaking throughout the whole movie . When I saw him win the Oscars , it scared me again .
 1530|5|Lethal Weapon combined drama and action in a fairly believable plot . One of my favorites .
15301|5|This may be the best movie I ve seen all year and I m certain it s one of the best roles of Kevin Kline s career . First the superfluous stuff ; gorgeous sets and locations as well as good costumes and a believable trip in the Wayback Machine to the 1970 s even though , we re talking boarding school uniforms and not the flashy , trashy polyester clothing from that era that those of us who remember it all grew to loath ( you guys know who you are because you are also probably the only ones who got the Wayback Machine reference ) . Now , for the more heady aspects of the film - this is obviously one of the better-written and well-directed films to come along in a great while in addition to being one of the more moving and meaningful . It managed to address the often forgotten subject of ethics and in a very straightforward , intelligent and very basic way . As to acting and the aforementioned great job by Kevin Kline I will say this ; he managed to convey with mere facial expressions what some actors could not with volumes of verbiage . I m convinced he s one of the best talents we have in the seasoned actors category . Emperor s Club was well worth the price of admission as well as the price of a rental a few months from now .
15302|5|Very good , very disturbing , and rather uncomfortable . Baldwin for once , is actually competent in this , and the rest of the cast is brilliant .
15308|5|Finding Forrester is one of the best movies I've seen not only in the past 2 or 3 years , but of my life . The main character is an urban kid and is really a genius . He's sent to a prestigious prep school and everyone doesn't think he's academically sound , yet he really is a genius . Everyone thinks the school took him for his equally amazing basketball ability . The friendship he forms with the intellectual writer William Forrester makes the movie a bit of a bildungsroman . I would emphatically recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it . It is a classic in my opinion .
15309|5|Robert Brown is another young actor that i would like to see more of . I would really likje to see a part two to this film .
15312|5|Without question this was the most DOCILE character portrayl I've ever seen Sean Connery play . . Ever . . . ! However , did I mention how beautifully Sean portrayed his character ? It was refreshing to see a white honkie become genuine friends with a black kid too . We need to get more of that out here in life . . . and start letting go of racial prejudice . That garbage has been run in the dirt . . . ! A very touching motion picture , Finding Forester .
15315|5|This movie was well developed . Connery's performance was fantastic , and Robert Brown is a natural . While the story was predictable , the relationships formed were very touching . The actors conveyed the feelings of the characters seemlessly to the screen , and the story was well formed and thought out . The young boy is put under pressure to which anyone can relate , and nothing is left in question . This movie is one of the reasons why I go to see movies .
15316|5|Great movie . The acting was superb and the plot well thought out . The tone of this movie was uplifting and it reaches out to all people who have a gift or dream that has not been realized .
15318|5|Saw Finding Forrester last night . What an excellent movie . No car chases , violence or sex , and yes it was predictable but that is because the movie was real . The characters made decisions and played the roles of real people not supper human , everything is perfect people . In all I thought the movie was great story telling . Several scenes could have been overplayed and overacted . The producer seemed to maintain a very tight reign on how far affects and acting played on emotion and opted to allow the story to become a participating character and fill those voids . Example , the scene where Wallace gets Forrester out of his apartment for the first time to go to a basketball game and Forrester gets lost and becomes very confused with great anxiety . This could have been over dramatized with effects , music , and human emotion building a grand suspense moment . Instead , they allow the story to remain the character and you to understand the moment not caught up in the drama . Some will not enjoy the movie simply because it is relatively flat . My enjoyment came from watching superb professionals portray their characters without the crutches of effects . Sometimes it is much harder to convince the audience you are the real character without the supporting cast of the special effects department . A great feel good movie that does not leave you emotionally rung out and exhausted at the end .
 1532|5|The on-screen chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover made this film as great as it was . Gibson played the tortured detective who you weren't sure or not if he was psychotic . And , Glover played the grizzled veteran detective who was anticipating is retirement right around the corner . The movie had tremendous action and laugh out loud comedy . It also featured a great performance by Gary Busey .
15324|5|Not a perfect movie , but one that finally shows Gus van Sant besting his great 1989 film ( debut ? ) Drugstore Cowboy . Forrester has the same gritty style of movie-making ( and a great Miles Davis-dominated soundtrack ) , but this time it's wrapped around an uplifting story of a supremely gifted black teenager and his discovery as a legendary mentor . Sure , the story is quite improbable and it glosses over A LOT . . . but Connery and Rob Brown are both excellent , so you wind up WANTING to forgive the plot lapses and hoping for the predictable ending . In a weak year for movies , I left this one thinking it was worth the trip .
15327|5|Hands down , the best movie that I have seen this year . Directed by the same guy who directed Good Will Hunting , the movie has a similar feel to that movie . Older father figure helps young genius reach his potential and learns something about himself along the way . Yet , it is very different and brilliantly written . Sean Connery and Rob Brown are both great ( I won't be surprised if they are up for Oscars ) . You walk out of this movie feeling good , but you aren't clobbered over the head with sweetness . I can't recommend a movie more highly . There is also a surprise cameo towards the end which will give you a chuckle .
 1533|5|What a great action movie . Lethal Weapon modernized the classic buddy picture ( e . g . , Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ) and ushered in a host of imitators that also pair up unlikely male buddies of different races ( Rush Hour , Last Boy Scout , Wild Wild West , just to name a few ) . But the imitators can't match the Mel Gibson / Danny Glover chemistry that drives the movie and makes you care about the characters . Lethal Weapon has great action scenes , great dialogue , and better acting than you'll find in most action movies .
15332|5|An excellent drama about the notorious female serial killer Aileen Wuonos . Charlize Theron did an excellent jon as the evil female serial killer and Christina Ricci did another excellent job as Wuonos's lesbian lover . Wuonos killed seven men in Florida in 1990 and she rightfully got the death penalty . She was executed in 2002 .
15334|5|I love Charlize ! ! It was amazing how they made her look like Aileen . She looked just like Aileen . . . but a younger version of her . This movie was excellent , and Charlize was stellar . This movie was a big break for her . The end was so sad and made me cry . I liked this movie so much that I bought it on dvd the first day it came out . Charlize definitely deserved all the awards she received for this film .
15335|5|This film was sad and very disturbing at times , but it was brilliant . Many times in films when they portray a serial killer you either hate them , sympathise with them or you simply don't get them . You absolutely cannot condone ruthless murders , but in Monster you gain an understanding of one woman's tactic for survival , a clear understanding of why she did what she did and most of all her universal search to be loved and accepted . Christina Ricci underplayed the character of Selby nicely and Charlize prooved that shes not just a pretty face by not only physically transforming herself , but mentally too . For the first time in a long time I can honestly say that someone rightfully deserved the Best Actress Oscar gong this year .
 1534|5|Mel Gibson's acting was superb . Great edge .
15340|5|A great movie ! Tom does it again . The wonderful tale of a man who comes here and is stripped of his nationality and money and is confined to JFK airport . A tribute to the immigrant , the character of those who come to this country and to those who remember what America really is . America does not promise success and riches equal to everyone else--it promises the opportunity and freedom to make the best for yourself ( all dependent on how hard you'll work to succeed ) . A fair trade .
15343|5|Should be up in the top twenty . . . . .
15345|5|The late great sax player Dexter Gordon was sensational as an expatriate American saxman dying in Paris . Paul Newman robbed him for the Oscar in 1986 .
15349|5|One of the best all time movies ever made . I loved it , aboslutly loved it . I just hoped they went into the lives of these great pilot's a bit more . Such as : By the end of WWII Yeager had shot down a total of 13 enemy aircraft . That in 1954 Yeager retired from testing rocket aircraft and returned to military flying only . There is no mentoin at all about Wally Schirra's six orbits in Oct . 62 . The most exiting details of Gordo Cooper's flight were left out , how he flew his spacecraft back after 34 hours and a ship that all systems were ethier dead or on there way . Pancho Barnes was indeed a test pilot , in 1929 she was flying expermintal aircraft such as the Lockheed J-5 . She also owned and operated her own flying circus . The fire that burnt her club to the ground was considered suspicious because the Air Force wanted that land and threatend to condem her club , acting as her own lawer , she won her case and was awarded $ 414 , 000 . The scene where Yeager loses control of his NF-104 and bails out happened 5 months after Coopers flight and 15 months after NASA moved to Houston , in the movie is is depicted during and before . All in all still one of the best movies ever .
15351|5|I thank this movie for teaching me what my history classes left out . What an educational experience , and it wasn't even boring !
15352|5|I wish I could be as cool as Chuck Yeager .
15353|5|A truly great American hero film ! The all star cast portraying astronauts is a guys excuse to miss Monday Night Football . The book was great , the movie did the book right . This is one of only a few movies I own on tape .
15357|5|This is one of my 2 favorite movies ; the other is Babe , Pig in the City . Babe is probably better for children , but BV is virtually flawless as a cinematic experience . I liked it much more on the second viewing than the first ; there aren't many movies that I can say that about . Mulholland Drive is great also .
 1536|5|I find it interesting that the only people who have commented negatively are a : linguistically challenged , and b : desire more action . Next time rent a playstation game folks . This is one of the top ten movies of the last ten years , and a brilliant adaptation of a complex novel . I think a good case can be made to put this movie in the top hundred all time , maybe top fifty . There are no flaws here .
15362|5|Great film with superlative directing from David lynch !
15363|5|This is one of those films where you love or loathe it . A true marvel of contemporary cinema . A real mystery , unravelled nicely , the performances are superb , Hoppers character Frank is a real cinema villain . Truly scary . A major league film .
15364|5|A dark tale of a young man who finds just underneath the lovely top soil of his beloved home town , Lumberton , lies a very , very , sick and twisted side . One he cannot fathom . Until the day he goes to pay a visit to his father in the hospital and on the way home finds a severed human ear . He takes it to the father of his good friend from school who happen to be a detective . The detectives daughter gives Jeffrey some tid bits of one of her fathers conversations about the case . This leads Jeffery to an eclectic older mysterious woman and through her he meets a drug addicted sadist named Frank . A dark and Erotic murder mystery begins to unfold around Jeffery and soon finds himself to be a major player in the sinister game . Blue Velvet is a master work of the phenominal director , David Lynch . One of his most noteworthy works and well deserving to be . Was nominated for best picture and best director in 1986 . Very surreal and beautiful with great symbolism through out . Another masterpiece from artist David Lynch . HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !
15365|5|This movie will blow your mind . It will scare the living crap out of you and there is some dark mystery to some of the dialogue that you may not catch the first time ; it will surprise you . David Lynch is a genius and Dennis Hopper will freak you out ! It's an experience !
15366|5|David Lynch's dark , yet tiumphant , rebound from the Dune disaster . Dennis Hopper's performance here is justifiably legendary .
15376|5|The movie was awesome ! ! ! ! and the people out there who think the movie sucked are probably just jelous cuz the actors and actresses in the movie's dreams came true !
15379|5|This movie was butta ! ! ! It is one of the very best movies I've seen . One reason is because they showed the problems between whites and blacks together .
15380|5|This movie is brilliant , possibly the best I've ever seen . It is a heartwarming story about inter- racial relationships , and overcoming tragic losses to become what you have always dreamed of becoming . Julia Stiles Sean Patrick Thomas are jammin' . They portray their characters so well , and are obviously very talented in both acting and dance . The story is well wrote , giving great depth on what really goes on in the real America , outside the glossy Hollywood . Well done Thomas Carter , a brilliant movie . Well done also to the writer ( s ) , and all actors , especially Julia Sean ! Absoloutly Brilliant ! PS . Sean is a real sizzler , and just for the record I am not Afican American .
15381|5|LOVED THE MOVIE ! IT WAS COOL N ALL ! ESPECIALLY FREDDRO STARR ! ETC . . .
15385|5|Save the last Dance was absolutely 'slammin' ( haha ) ! ! ! It was so excellent ! ! It made me wanna get up and dance myself ! ! ! ! I cried like five times . ! ! ! ! ! ! Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas were so good together , both they're talents complimented each other ! ! ! One to watch if you wanna laugh and cry ! ! ! ! !
15387|5|i think save the last dance was a VERY good movie ! ! it had all the sweet romantic things a long with the fighting sences all the guys like ! ! if i had to , i would watch that movie EVERY day ! !
15388|5|OMG ! I loved that movie and Sean Patrick Thomas went to my school . . . He's so gorgous . . i saw the movie like 6 times already . It's def . the best movie .
 1539|5|Released in 1997 and directed by Curtis Hanson , L . A . Confidential was a throwback to the original film noir , seedy detective films of the 1940's and 50's . For the uninitiated , the movie tells the story of three mismatched Los Angeles police detectives , Bud White ( Russell Crowe ) , Ed Exley ( Guy Pearce ) , and Jack Vincennes ( Kevin Spacey ) , who get entangled in several interrelated schemes involving high-dollar prostitutes , police corruption , and organized crime . The story is complex , and the characters are intriguing as they put aside their conflicting personal philosophies and personalities to unravel the conspiracies . James Cromwell does his normal stellar job in a supporting rule ( Police Chief Dudley Smith ) , and Kim Basinger was okay as prostitute Lynn Bracken ( though I did not see how her screen time merited the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress ) . On more technical matters , the pace of the film and cinematography is well done to give the movie that retro film noir aura . The bottom line is that L . A . Confidential is a very good mystery drama along the lines of Chinatown ( 1974 ) .
15390|5|i thought that the movie was great ! ! it was a really good story !
15392|5|This is the best movie that I've seen since John Singleton's Boyz N The Hood . If you're into hip-hop / ghetto dramas , this is a must-see . I also recommend Dangerous Minds , Colors , and Boyz N the Hood .
15393|5|I think this movie is very good . It was very well made and has a great plot .

15411|5|save the last dance was one of the best movies i've ever seen because not only did it have terrific dancing , but it dealt with real issues in the world , such as rasicm
15412|5|Save the Last Dance was the BEST movie ! ! ! I'm deffinetley getting it on video when it come out ! I can't wait ! It really teaches you a lesson about racisim . It's sad and and funny ! I reccommend this movie to everyone ! ! ! ! !

15416|5|Julia and Sean were perfect for each other in this movie ! It had a good story line and the hip hop was really cool . Over all it was a really fun movie .
15417|5|Save the Last Dance is one of the few movies that I would pay to see more than once ! It was entertaining and a tear-jerker . Sean Patrick Thomas is a cutie and is definitely an up-and-coming actor ! ! ! ! !
 1542|5|A great movie with an excellent cast . The script was brilliant . Kim Basinger gave an awesome performance .
15422|5|I absolutely loved the movie ! It was an awesome hip-hop / dance movie that my mom even loved !
15423|5|I JUST SAW THIS LAST NIGHT ! I THINK THAT SEAN AND JULIA ARE GREAT ACTORS AND TO ME SAVE THE LAST DANCE SHOULD BE THE NUMBER 1 MOVIE IN AMERICA . BUT THAT IS JUST ME . IT ROCKED
15424|5|This is my new FAVE movie . It's SOOOOOO awesome . Only one word describes it Awesomness Juila Stiles and Sean Were awesome together ! It just makes me wanna get up and dance around ! ! ! ! ! ! ITS TOTALLY THE BEST MOVIE !
15425|5|As of now this is my favorite movie . Julia was so great in this movie she put on a good performance as she is a killer dancer . . . . . .
15428|5|Save the last dance is the Grease of 2001 !
15433|5|This is a very romantic , different movie . Loved it !
15442|5|I wasn't sure what to expect out of this movie . I bought it at first , because Mark Ruffalo is in it . It isn't a film for everyone , but I loved it . It takes you through a wide range of emotions . And although it ends tragically , it leaves you with a lot to think about .
15443|5|This is a very art-house film and isn't something for everyone . I wasn't sure if a film about a twenty-three-year-old dying was going to be interesting and was hesitant about hiring such a film . I made a right choice as this film is amazing . Sarah Polley ( Go ) gave a very tender and emotional performance of a young woman dying and trying to do things shes never done before during her final days on earth . I can understand why she didn't make the choice to tell her family as she didn't want a pity party , but if you don't well-up as she makes a tape for her two children for their Birthday each year right up to the age of eighteen , then you missed a very sensitive part of the film .
15446|5|WOW . . . Cate Blanchett was very excellent as Guerin and Ciaran Hinds was equally convincing as the conniving John Trainor .
 1545|5|An absolutely excellent and surprising movie with screenbreaking vibes between Basinger and Crowe ! A thrilling story , excellent actors , great music : Bravo to the Director Curtis Hanson
15453|5|This is the best movie of the year and possibly in recent years . The film touches on many subjects without being preachy , leaving the viewers with room for interpretations and thoughts which I think is clever . The music score and cinematography are perfect . I indeed prefer the movie than the book which can actually be preachy and full of prpogandas . For those who are offended by the abortion and incest themes , give me a break . What is the morality portrayed in American Beauty ( guns , infidelity and rape of the underaged girl ! ) ? Why people rarely condemn the themes in Pulp Fiction ( totally rubbish film which makes swearing sound cool and violence a norm ) ? I think many Americans are rather bored by such heart warming films like The Cider House Rules but cherish the violence and perverty in the aforementioned films . No wonder America has so many gunshot cases because people are so used to violence that guns are still not banned !
15456|5|Interesting plot and great representation of the novel . Eryka Badu , Delroy Lindo , Mindreal Fane , is a great ensamble put together . I especially like the scene when Lindo confesses toward the end . It was a very deep scene .
15459|5|Really enjoyed this film , acting was superb , great storyline , great lines and music . . . felt good leaving the theater . . .
 1546|5|This is one of the best films in the last 10 years . Infinately better than Titanic ( eughhhh ) , and a great crime movie , L . A . Confidential is a mature thriller that delivers the goods . Very similar to Chinatown , but how could that ever be a bad thing ? In my opinion , damn good . A must-see . Summary : A MATURE THRILLER THAT CERTAINLY DELIVERS THE GOODS .
15463|5|This was easily the best movie of the year for me-much better than Green Mile , or Mr . Ripley . . What a wonderful story , and what BEAUTIFUL scenery-made me long for the Northeast . I was engrossed form tyhe first minute , and left feeling emotionally fullfilled , but not drained .
15468|5|A wonderful film with unforgettable performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn . She definitely deserved her Academy Award for this characterization of the nun who is compelled to feel the anguish of victims and perpetrators alike . Demonstrates that the gray area between right and wrong is large . And I think it makes a compelling case for compassion toward all .
 1547|5|The perfect modern film-noir . Screenplay , direction , casting , acting , cinematography were all excellent ! It all comes together and of course has many surprises in store for the viewer . Much , much more than a glitzy remake of a 1950's detective story as it begins to appear at first .
15470|5|This movie was based on the prison system and how innocent people are wrongly accused . The prisoner accused of the crime was sentenced to death when his partner only got life . The one who got life was wealthy and could afford a good legal defense , while the one sentenced to death was poor and had to have council appointed for him . It shouldn't matter if you are a person who is rich or poor , if they did the crime they should pay for it .
15472|5|Great movie ! I found the movie gripping and believable . Most movies that deal with the supernatural tend to be 'unrealistic' , not only in its content but in its execution as well . This film was perfect . Great cast .
15474|5|One of the best movies ever made . Brought many tears to my eyes . The acting was the best I've ever seen . One of the few movies I consider perfect .
15481|5|Bruce Greenwood didn't really play Kennedy very well in the movie , but the screenplay of the movie was excellent nonetheless . It moves very quickly without getting mired in detail , which is a tendency in movies that recreate actual events . It hit all of the strategic concerns revolving around the Missile Crisis . Really this event was the turning point in the Cold War . Policymakers came to grips with the fact that nuclear annihilation was a very real possibility with escalating conflict . Thirteen Days very accurately portrayed the myriad of potential solutions to the deadlock like war with the Soviets or a blockade . The Joint Chiefs wanted war while the civilian leadership was more cautious . If you want a peek at how official Washington operates , take a look at this movie . The movie portrays the high point of the Kennedy administration , one that has a decidedly mixed record ( sorry Redoedo ) . He got off to a very slow start but I would say that this was his baptismal by fire . He played hardball with the Soviets after this . The Cuban Missile Crisis also really changed the whole dynamic of the Cold War . The realities of nuclear annihilation became a very real , tangible possibility . The US and the Soviets had to improve relations or else there would have been a nuclear exchange ; something that wouldn't have benefitted anyone at the end of the day . So anyways , minus Greenwood's bad portrayal of Kennedy , I would say it's a great movie .
15483|5|I just saw this movie a few nights ago- and all I can say is WOW . What a film ! It is probably one of the most accurate historical dramas of our time . Definately up at the top of the list of the movies of the last few years . Two things bugged me about this film- the role of Ken O'Donnell was sorely misrepresented as he did not have nearly as much of a role in the crisis . The other was Kevin Costner's ridiculous attempt at a Boston accent . Other than that- this really proved to be an entertaining film with supurb acting , even by Kevin Costner . The actor who played John Kennedy , Bruce Greenwood was astounding- he had Kennedy's accent down pact . Overall , I would recommend this to even people who are not too fond of Kennedy as it does not portray him as some kind of a God , even mentioning his attempts at assassinating Castro during his term in office . Bruce Greenwood did a great job of communicating the President's struggles with the audience . Definately a film to see !
15489|5|When I first heard about 13 Days I thought It sounded like a great movie . But the main reason I was going was to see the trailer for Lord of the Rings . But by the time 13 Days was over , I'd forgotten all about Lord of the Rings . Being from Canada , I wasn't very familiar with the story . All I knew was that the situation must've been resolved , since I knew nothing of a war between the States and Cuba . But having an idea about how the movie would end didn't spoil it at all . Every second of this movie was fascinating . It was intense without having action sequences . The high point in my opinion is the performance given by the actor portraying Bobby Kennedy . I can easily say that 13 Days is one of my favorite movies of the last few years , and I can't wait to see it again . It was quite a long movie , but it kept my interest throughout every scene . 13 Days is currently on top of my movie recommending list .
15497|5|First thing is first . If u scroll down . hpulba had written a comment saying this movie was underrated . This movie is the highest-selling movie in the US and the world , and won 11 Academy Awards , more than any other movie . So what the hell were you talking about ? Second , Robin Hood if you are going to bash a movie by saying dumb dumb and dumber , make sure you spell dumber correctly . This movie was a great movie , acting was kinda shady , but a great movie overall .
15501|5|I luv this movie . . my absolute fav movie . . leonardo is so frickin hott . . . luv him ! ! !
15504|5|I can't believe this movie is so underrated . It made me cry badly at the end ! I do care about what happened to the Titanic , but the charactors gave life to the story . I still cry every time I watch it . ( Well , nearly . ) One problem though , it was a bit too long .
15518|5|The first time I went to see Titanic at the theatre , I had bought one of those 32 oz fountain drinks . I was so engulfed in the movie that I hardly drank any of my drink , and in the last 30 minutes of the movie , the bottom of my cup fell out and spilled all over my lap ! But the movie was so good I sat there in the soda and finished watching it . I can say no movie has ever touched me this much to put up with that . . lol . But in any event , I went to see the TITANIC the next weekend without any accidents , and I loved it the 2nd time as well . I have seen it several times since then at home , and still never get tired of it . This is one of 2 movies that I actually loved to see Leo DiCaprio star in . The first being Gilbert Grape . I still don't have any idea how he pulled it off . I also love the theme song by Celine Dion . Excellent film and soundtrack ! I recommend the movie to all families !
15519|5|A Five Star all the way . The Titanic won so many awards also . Great special effects . The romance between Jack and Rose was so sweet at the begining but very very sad at the end .
15522|5|I agree with Niterider ( sorta ) , it really is a good movie , it's my favorite movie , very romantic and great acting . It should be at # 1 .
15525|5|Best movie ever made ! !
 1553|5|A beautiful noir film . You're girlfriend will love you for Russel Crowe . You'll love it for the bad guys , with an engaging story and spirited performances , L . A . Confidential will grip you .
15537|5|This movie was great ! But very dramatic .
15539|5|Classic love-tale made in the same vain as GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA . Films like this come only once in a great while , so you had better learn to like it as I have .
 1554|5|L . A . Confidential is a pretty recently released flick that is now one of my personal favorites . A movie masterfally directed with a steller cast including Kevin Spacey , Kim Basinger , Danny DeVito , and the Marvelous Russel Crowe . A must see for everyone .
15544|5|When this first came out I did not want to see it . I though , I know what happends anyway , people go on ship , ship sinks , people die . Plus I hate that leonardo dicaprio While that was tragic , I didn't think is should be a movie . So it wasn't until it was released again in the theaters that I was finally draged to go see it . I can honestly say I'm glad I saw it on the big sceen . The story was superb , the acting was superb ( even leonardo dicaprio ) , and the music went very well with each part of the movie . The directing and set was the best i've ever seen , it makes you feel like your there , the feel of the movie is so well portraid that each character , even small roles are a integral part in this flim . I can go on and on about the magnificent directing and charcter development , but the only way anyone can understand is if they see it for themselves .
15546|5|Absolutely astounishing movie , great talented actors , meaningful story , very entertaining for all ages . Unsinkable movie .
15549|5|This was a really great movie . I've seen it a million times and I still like it . I'm not really a fan of romantic sort of movies , but this one I liked . It's a bit of a chick flick , but it's a good one . It even has a bit of humour in it despite the movie being about a horrible tragedy . It's a long movie , but it is a good one .
15550|5|When it first came out in the theatre , I refused to go see it because I was sure that I would not like it . . . now I have seen it several times and really like it each time .
15553|5|A great movie . Good stories for everyone . Good music and very good direction . An artistic movie , integrated with romance .
15555|5|This was a great love story . I actually thought it would be boring , but the relationship Jack and Rose had was beautiful . Never a boring scene in the movie , and will keep you wanting to watch it over and over again to feel what the Titanic victims felt .
15558|5|This movie made me cry . It's as though they were meant to be together , but in the end , fate separated them . That's the irony . Plus , it showed the reactions of people during a crisis . Made me think of what I would do .
 1556|5|Great film ! I can watch it over and over . All the acting is great ; Kevin Spacey is awesome . One of my top five all time favorites .
15560|5|It is based on a true story . The story is told by one of the survivors . It shows how much love meant to Rose so that she would even fake a new life .
15562|5|Based on a true story that did indeed happen in the past . Best picture of that year . Suspense , action and drama .
15565|5|An excellent movie . Watched it three times and bought the video . It was very realistic and well documented .
15567|5|If the earth still exists in a thousand years from now . Titanic will still be there . And probably the only one from this list . It's powerful ! Too many things are shown in it . Far more than just the sinking tragedy
15570|5|The action was great because of all the special effects . Leonardo and Kate made the story great because they were both meant for each other . It was a great remake from all the other old remakes .
 1558|5|If you liked Russell Crowe in Gladiator , you'll love him as Bud White , an uncompromising LA cop with a short temper and zero tolerance for women beaters . This movie drags one deep into the corruption of 1950's LA police , with twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end .
15580|5|I like the Titanic movie very much because it possesses love and emotion .
15584|5|The movie was very dramatic . I like how James Cameron used computer graphics to make the setting ( ship , furniture , art , ocean ) seem real . The best part is the way he used the storyline to fit in the actual shipwreck .
15587|5|Not as historic as entertaining . I liked it because it humanized a very terrible accident . Many people just look at the numbers of the victims and not their stories . Titanic made us aware of their possible stories .
15588|5|Three full hours of drama in the movie theater . There was comedy , but most importantly , drama that caught everyone's heart .
 1559|5|This movie is good ! The storyline kept me on the edge of my seat . Every character showed growth and development that every movie should have . I love Kim Basinger .
15594|5|Titanic is the greatest mid-20's love story of all time . It mostly appeals to a younger audience but viewers of all ages cannot deny it's powerful story and lovable characters . Everyone cries !
15595|5|The best movie hollywood has came up with in a very long time , and I think it will be a very long time before we see another one like it . The story , the special effects , the actors , the soundtrack , it all came together perfect !
15598|5|When I walked out of Titanic on Jan 2 , 1998 , I thought to myself that the world is much better off for its extistence . That it was going to be interesting to see how our culture reacted to a big , glamorous epic all about the value of an individual life ( set against this horrible spectacle of mass death ) . Unfortunately , we soon learned that our President was using interns for sex while having phone conversations about sending boys to fight in Bosnia , then finishing himself off in the sink off the Oval Office , and this instead was the defining cultural moment of '98 . Oh well , its still a great movie . That scene with the musicians playing a final song , as you see others saying their final goodbyes to the world in modest peace , its completely heart-wrenching . And Leo did a completely amazing job at pulling off a purely good character that doesn't get boring .
  156|5|excellent movie ! what do ya expect from a great author as thomas harris ! i cant wait for # 2 !
15602|5|Titanic is a wonderful movie and anybody who can't see that is either a fool or has to be somewhat hard hearted . Anybody should be able to like this movie ! It's wonderful in every way ! This movie does not stink at all and the acting is just great ! I have a feeling that there are a lot of jealous people out there who will never be able to be in a movie like this so they unfaily try to drag it down with their rude and untrue comments . This is a great film that everyone should see !
15606|5|I don't think it was by any means one of the best ever , but I do think it was a great movie . Enormously enjoyable , and classic for the 90s .
15607|5|CGI RAPHICS WITH A CLASSIC STORY- ONE FOR THEBOYS AND GIRLS
 1561|5|It's a wonderful movie , with great actors and better performances .
15611|5|Titanic is my favorite movie from this list because it has all the qualities of a great movie . The plot was interesting . There was humor , romance , suspense , and adventure .
15612|5|This movie was awesome . It was very entertaining and made me cry .
15613|5|Titanic has everything beautiful protagonists , exciting story , wonderful special effects , and it makes you laugh and cry ! This is no surprise considering it's directed by the Master Steven Spielberg .
15617|5|I believe that titanic is one of the best movies I seen , it's very emotional
15621|5|I really loved this movie . I had heard some criticism that the supporting characters were more dynamic than Ada and Inman , but to be fair , Ada and Inman are reserved and introverted people . I had also heard that the Southern accents were not that good , but I did not think they were really that bad . Jude Law portrayed Inman as a strong but silent type , who will stop at nothing to be reunited with his sweetheart . What woman wouldn't want a lover as devoted and romantic as Inman ? Nicole Kidman did not stretch herself as she did in The Hours . Ada came off as a bit too delicate and ephemeral , but perhaps we were seeing her through Inman's eyes , whose perception of his ladylove was very idealized . Renee Zellweger chewed the scenery as the capable Ruby , who helped Ada revitalize her farm and avoid starvation . Philip Seymour Hoffman was masterful as the lecherous preacher , and I believe if he had had a few more scenes he would have been nominated for a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor award . I imagine we are going to see a lot more of this gifted character actor . I agree with previous reviewers that the cinematography was gorgeous ; although Cold Mountain was filmed in Romania , that pristine , mountainous country looks like North Carolina . Finally , I am glad I chose Cold Mountain as a birthday present for myself ; it makes an excellent addition to my growing DVD collection .
15629|5|Powerful , often times violent movie . Life really sucked during the Civil War . Terrific cast , Rene Zellweger as Ruby being the best . Jude Law is wonderful as Inman . Nicole Kidman is great as Ada . Great small parts by Giovanni Ribisi and Phillip Seymour Hoffman .
15633|5|An awesome movie . I thought Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were great . Even though I'm not a fan of Renee Zellwegger I thought she did really good on her role . Even though I think Nicole Kidman totally pops , I don't think she should win Best Actress because there wasn't much intelligent / incredible acting she could of done in that movie .
15634|5|I love this movie .
15635|5|This movie shows that anything can happen to any1 with perserverance
 1564|5|I thought this movie was excellent-so few people gave it props , but after I saw it , I bought it and I watch it all the time .
15640|5|It's an AMAZING story and I absolutely love the costumes !
15645|5|Yes , I admit I'm a sappy romantic , but I don't get caught up in many movies that try to be romantic . This one got to me -- I just loved it . I saw it in the theater 5 times .
15649|5|I am usually not a Shakespeare person because I can not understand what they are saying , but I really liked this movie with Gwenyth Paltrow because it was romantic and the main actors were current ones we could relate to .
15655|5|I thought this was a very cleverly done film and was extremely entertaining . Shakespeare in Love was probably one of the few films I've seen in the last two years that I didn't walk out of feeling like I had just been screwed out of $ 8 . 50 , and would've been willing to pay another $ 8 . 50 to see again while it was in the theatres . Very well done , very well acted , it was an all around entertaining film with some wonderful lines and metaphors . To the point of another user who said Shakespeare would be spinning in his grave I can think of nothing more than you really have no idea what you're talking about . In fact I would argue that Shakespeare would be amazed and overjoyed by this adaption / reproduction of his work . Certainly Shakespeare was an innovator of his time don't you think he would be happy to see , first of all just that his work was STILL being produced , and secondly that they had spun it into such a humorous form while still retaining the overall storyline ? I do .
15657|5|No independent film had success like this film . I thought it was so well written , even if you don't like Shakespeare . The writing created wonderful characters and I love how accurate they were in presenting the issue of women not being able to act then .
15658|5|Great story about what if . . . Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful in the diverse rolls she plays .
15661|5|Good movie . Very emotional . I love how the actors played their roles .
15662|5|Besides being entertaining , this movie had many messages within it that came across in subtle ways . It clearly and effectively conveyed the meaning of love . Insight was needed to understand such messages , but it was well worth it .
15663|5|I don't much care for Paltrow , but even she was good in this . A truly beautiful motion picture . Well-written !
15664|5|Dramatic . Sensitive . Romantic . Intellectual . I loved it .
15665|5|Shakespeare . . . in love ? Hey , I'm in love in Joe Fiennes . Not only is he gorgeous , fab eyes , but he can act . He was perfect in the part and tripped through the language as though it was 2000 and made the love affair timeless .
15666|5|AMAZING movie , great music , great writing , great acting , great story . . . . and shakespeare is HOT
15667|5|I loved this movie very witty writing and well made I could watch it again and again .
15669|5|the theatre on screen
15670|5|I'm not if it should have won best picture , however .
15671|5|This was one of the most entertaining , beautiful movies I have seen !
15676|5|Great performances and a true story that are tough to beat ; Gooding and DeNiro at their best .
 1568|5|Great fun ! Didn't expect it to be such a ride ! I even liked Johnny Depp in this . He's a great actor if a little bizarre sometimes .
15689|5|I believe this is life after death . So of course I love this movie . If I can see some of my beliefs in film I agree to love it .
15690|5|this movie has so much potential and it carries with it so many different emotions , such as : Joy and sadness . Robin Williams has perfected the character very well and the way his heaven is his wives paintings is an idea I have never heard before . You really have to watch it several times to understand it !
15693|5|This is a wonderfully crafted film . The imagery is amazing , brilliant colors are used in a way to convey feelings in the heaven scene , and then dark colors for hell are used to convey that . The story is profound and invokes thought . Robin Williams does a good acting job .
15695|5|One of the best visual and dramatic films . This movie is rich with philosophy and mythology . It just boggles the mind . This movie was sooooo good . I want to go to the heaven they went to . The symbols they used were so good . This movie did a lot for me . I love the way he sacrificed himself for his wife . He loved her so much that he would rather live with her in hell than live without her in heaven . It reminded me of the legend of Orpheus and Euridicye .
15696|5|I found the blend of surreal with real and pure fantasy to be amazing . The imagery was so impressive . One of the best parts was the movies ability to deal with such an obviously religious topic without referring to any specific religion .
  157|5|A thriller without supermen gentlemen ! Good ! : o )
 1570|5|Plain out , great movie . I loved every aspect of it , and the acting was all very well done . Johnny Depp portrayed Jack Sparrow very well , as did Orlnado Bloom as Will .
15700|5|This is a truly creative film . It doesn't just draw you to the main character , but opens doors in your psyche you didn't know existed . It didn't bring out joy , sadness , nor thrill in me like typical films . I accessed a void , now longing to fill . It's hard to explain . I didn't know if I should cry , stop watching , kill myself . It was a trip .
15702|5|Very interesting and original . Different perspective on the afterlife . Bound to make one cry .
15706|5|This is beautiful .
 1571|5|This is the best pirate film in ages . Costuming great . The Acting waqs good . Though really Johnny Depp stole the show .
