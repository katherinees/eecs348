9892|1|Come on guys ! anyone who said this movie was even worth wasting your time is crazy ! I didn't think it would be the best movie , but it was sooooo stupid . All it was about was vulgur crap . it wasn't even stupid funny , it wasn't funny at all ! ! ! it was way to childish and corny .
9912|1|This movie is too stupid . It goes beyond stupid funny ( like Jim Carrey ) , and stops at horribly stupid funny .
9941|1|This movie sucked . There were a few funny parts but overall it wsa just really disgusting . Also , it had absolutely no plot .
9943|1|What the heck was Scary Movie about ? Man , it was all about penises and boobs ! The movie had no point whatsoever . I thought it was going to be a funny , good movie when I saw the commercial for it . So , I went to go watch it on the first day the movie came out . I came out dissapointed . I really expected much more .
9945|1|It sucked . I hated it . It wasn't funny . Some parts were too explicit , like the deaths and showing a penis . I went with my ex-girlfriend . Usually the movies she picks out are good but she couldn't cover up this terrible movie .
9948|1|I thought this movie was dumb . I should have went high . Seriously , I laughed once .
9952|1|If there is a zero in the rating system , I would give it to this movie . It could be that this is 'the biggest wast of time ever . . . ' . I lost 2 hours of my life watching 'Stupid Movie' .
9958|1|There is no plot but just a montage of recent horror movies . The previews do not reflect the movie's poorly written plot . Just seems like they wanted to show as many penises as possible .
  10|5|Perhaps the perfect action thriller movie . Funny , suspenseful , dramatic , action packed . Has it all .
 100|5|A well constructed thriller .
1000|5|My favorite action movie yet !
10001|5|I love this movie ! I bought it on DVD when it came out . It's better than the original , and Jamie Lee and Lindsey were great .
10006|5|funny funny funny
10007|5|Really funny
1001|5|The first time I saw this was in a huge . packed cinema with surround sound etc . . I left feeling exhausted , as if I had actually been involved in the scenario . Excellent , and you can watch it over and over again .
10011|5|Funny movie all around . It's kinda weird to see Professor McGonagall from the Harry Potter flicks as a nun ! Great musical interpetation of MY GUY by the nun's choir . Rather than making fun of religion , I think it shows that religion can be a fun thing , and there is nothing wrong with that ! !
10012|5|On e of the best movies that Whoopi made !
