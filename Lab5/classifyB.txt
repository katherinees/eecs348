2|0|This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
6|0|A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .
13|0|The performances are an absolute joy .
21|0|Best indie of the year , so far .
32|0|Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .
38|0|The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '
41|0|Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
43|0|If a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then They works spectacularly well ... A shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .
49|0|Jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .
50|0|Bloody Sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made .
53|0|Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
54|0|Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
55|0|Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is .
56|0|Both lead performances are Oscar-size .
57|0|Run for your lives !
66|0|Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .

80|0|An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud .
85|0|Tells a fascinating , compelling story .
87|0|Highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .
88|0|In IMAX in short , it 's just as wonderful on the big screen .

96|0|Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .
97|0|`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
107|0|One of recent memory 's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise .
109|0|Filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power .
113|0|The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
118|0|300 years of Russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness .
121|0|`` Spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff .
127|0|A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .
130|0|A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .
136|0|One of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .
137|0|Intriguing and downright intoxicating .
139|0|The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
141|0|Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
147|0|When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .
151|0|Spielberg 's realization of a near-future America is masterful .
152|0|There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
167|0|Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
171|0|Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
176|0|Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
178|0|Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
179|0|Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing .
190|0|The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
199|0|This is a superior horror flick .
206|0|Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .
207|0|It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor .
210|0|It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
216|0|Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
223|0|Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
225|0|The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
227|0|It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
234|0|Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
235|0|Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
238|0|... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .
239|0|Miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .
241|0|Provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' I need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending .
242|0|Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
246|0|This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .
248|0|Sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -LRB- as best I remember -RRB- , but still a very good time at the cinema .
250|0|Black-and-white and unrealistic .
252|0|The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .
255|0|Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .
259|0|The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .
263|0|Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .
269|0|Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .
270|0|Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
271|0|A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .
277|0|The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
279|0|Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
280|0|In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
281|0|A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
287|0|-LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .
289|0|Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .
294|0|`` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .
297|0|While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .
298|0|There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .
299|0|A dreary movie .
310|0|Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .
312|0|... irritating soul-searching garbage .
315|0|In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
317|0|Except it 's much , much better .
318|0|It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .
321|0|So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up .
322|0|It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
325|0|See it .
329|0|A relative letdown .
334|0|Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .
338|0|One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
360|0|Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` Scratch '' a second look .
363|0|Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
365|0|The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
366|0|With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
369|0|Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
372|0|`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .
374|0|An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .
375|0|Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .
376|0|Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .
377|0|Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .
381|0|Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .
382|0|Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
383|0|This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
385|0|Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .
388|0|Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .
394|0|As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .
397|0|Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
408|0|Consistently clever and suspenseful .
412|0|Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
417|0|The asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of Jia with his family .
418|0|I walked away from this new version of E.T. just as I hoped I would -- with moist eyes .
419|0|Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
421|0|It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
427|0|-LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
428|0|This beautifully animated epic is never dull .
431|0|frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet 's crimes a political context
435|0|It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
438|0|It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .
446|0|A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .
449|0|Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
463|0|A wry , affectionate delight .
474|0|An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .
475|0|An extremely unpleasant film .
479|0|I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .
480|0|Intelligent and moving .
486|0|... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
487|0|It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
490|0|Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
491|0|This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .
493|0|Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .
495|0|An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .
497|0|Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
501|0|Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .
507|0|But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
509|0|I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .
517|0|An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .
518|0|I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
519|0|A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in Renaissance Spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .
521|0|Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
530|0|... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .
539|0|` This movie sucks . '
544|0|The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .
548|0|After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
552|0|While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
560|0|Peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the Dogtown experience .
561|0|As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .
565|0|Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .
571|0|Goofy , nutty , consistently funny .
572|0|Audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .
577|0|We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
578|0|Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .
590|0|It 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
594|0|A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .
600|0|The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .
603|0|Writer and director Otar Iosseliani 's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in Venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls .
604|0|A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences .
605|0|Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
611|0|It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
617|0|The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary Space Station 3D .
618|0|A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .
620|0|Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .
622|0|Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .
623|0|An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .
627|0|It 's just rather leaden and dull .
637|0|As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
641|0|or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
645|0|... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .
646|0|A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
647|0|Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .
649|0|It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
650|0|Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?
652|0|All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .
657|0|So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .
659|0|In other words , it 's badder than bad .
660|0|Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .
663|0|Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .
669|0|So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
671|0|Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
675|0|-LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up .
676|0|Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in Birthday Girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .
677|0|In his debut as a director , Washington has a sure hand .
678|0|-- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while .
681|0|It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .
683|0|The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
689|0|It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
695|0|Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .
697|0|This movie is to be cherished .
698|0|The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .
700|0|While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .
706|0|A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .
709|0|Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .
710|0|Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
711|0|I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .

717|0|Poetry in motion captured on film .
722|0|Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .

735|0|Perhaps the best sports movie I 've ever seen .
746|0|The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .
755|0|Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .
760|0|From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
765|0|You can sip your vintage wines and watch your Merchant Ivory productions ; I 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a Jerry Bruckheimer flick any day of the week .
767|0|A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .
772|0|Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .
785|0|It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
791|0|The movie is a trove of delights .
795|0|A well-executed spy-thriller .
798|0|More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
804|0|Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
807|0|Execrable .
833|0|More than anything else , Kissing Jessica Stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake Sleepless in Seattle again and again .
836|0|Not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season .
841|0|Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .
843|0|Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .

845|0|The Bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they 've told a nice little story in the process .
847|0|This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .

865|0|A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
868|0|The IMAX screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation .
877|0|` The War of the Roses , ' trailer-trash style .

881|0|... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
882|0|Charlotte Sometimes is a brilliant movie .
884|0|Godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence .

889|0|Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
892|0|`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .

897|0|No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
898|0|-LRB- Ramsay -RRB- visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .

904|0|Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
909|0|Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
910|0|This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .
914|0|A captivating new film .
920|0|An uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , The Grey Zone does have a center , though a morbid one .
922|0|So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
929|0|Collateral Damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it were n't .
931|0|Swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .
947|0|This is a very funny , heartwarming film .
949|0|I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
968|0|A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .
970|0|The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
971|0|It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
978|0|The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
983|0|A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude .
995|0|What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
996|0|I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
997|0|There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
1002|0|An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .

1011|0|Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .
1018|0|-LRB- A -RRB- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting .
1021|0|The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .

1047|0|My own minority report is that it stinks .
1050|0|Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
1052|0|finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed

1076|0|Jagger , Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride .
1081|0|For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
1082|0|On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
1086|0|A poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .
1088|0|Charlie Hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a Dickensian hero .
1089|0|Measured against practically any like-themed film other than its Oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor The Silence of the Lambs , Red Dragon rates as an exceptional thriller .
1091|0|Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
1095|0|Reassuring , retro uplifter .
1099|0|The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
1101|0|Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
1110|0|What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
1111|0|At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
1112|0|Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
1114|0|Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .
1115|0|Truly terrible .
1116|0|LaBute masterfully balances both Traditional or Modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other .
1124|0|The film is one of the year 's best .
1126|0|Davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft Ally McBeal-style fantasy sequences .
1128|0|One of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .
1129|0|What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is .
1131|0|Matthew Lillard is born to play Shaggy !
1132|0|Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
1133|0|... is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness -LRB- the way Chekhov is funny -RRB- , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality .
1141|0|The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .
1149|0|Elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy .
1162|0|Press the delete key .
1163|0|The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
1169|0|Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle ' .
1171|0|A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .
1172|0|It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
1174|0|One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
1178|0|Amazing !
1185|0|A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .
1187|0|Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
1188|0|The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .
1190|0|The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .
1209|0|A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .
1210|0|A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
1211|0|Astonishing ... -LRB- frames -RRB- profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment .
1216|0|A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .
1220|0|This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
1224|0|An energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching -LRB- or turntablism -RRB- in particular .
1227|0|Compellingly watchable .
1232|0|Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .
1241|0|Maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .
1245|0|Kinnear ... gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers .
1246|0|Their work is fantastic .
1248|0|Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
1251|0|the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
1261|0|The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
1262|0|unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
1265|0|A dazzling dream of a documentary .
1266|0|An intelligently made -LRB- and beautifully edited -RRB- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch .
1271|0|Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .
1275|0|There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
1277|0|A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
1292|0|The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
1294|0|Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before .
1298|0|-LRB- A -RRB- real pleasure in its laid-back way .
1299|0|Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
1307|0|Throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .
1308|0|He does this so well you do n't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role .
1312|0|-LRB- Washington 's -RRB- strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene .
1323|0|Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible
1324|0|Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .
1325|0|Enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast .
1327|0|At its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture .
1331|0|A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
1337|0|The actors are fantastic .
1348|0|` Drumline ' shows a level of young , Black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated .
1349|0|This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
1351|0|This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .
1353|0|A beautifully observed character piece .
1355|0|Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .
1357|0|In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
1360|0|After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
1363|0|What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
1368|0|This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
1369|0|Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .
1370|0|The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .
1371|0|An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .
1373|0|There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
1379|0|There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
1381|0|The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
1383|0|A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .
1395|0|This thing is virtually unwatchable .
1397|0|What a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride .
1407|0|Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
1408|0|A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .
1409|0|But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .
1413|0|The production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating .
1419|0|Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .
1420|0|Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil .
1423|0|The history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling .
1429|0|I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .
1430|0|An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .
1431|0|... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... The film 's ending has a `` What was it all for ? ''
1436|0|The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .
1443|0|A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
1446|0|Entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare I say , entertaining !
1447|0|`` Red Dragon '' is entertaining .
1453|0|Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
1456|0|Scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern Lothario .
1460|0|Jeffrey Tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is Oscar-worthy .
1462|0|Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .
1466|0|To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
1467|0|It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
1468|0|At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .
1469|0|You have to see it .
1470|0|If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
1477|0|With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
1483|0|Brian Tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .
1486|0|A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
1488|0|Just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer .
1489|0|It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
1493|0|Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .
1497|0|A simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm .
1500|0|A genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .
1501|0|Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .
1506|0|A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .
1507|0|One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ...
1511|0|The characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life .
1513|0|Deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .
1520|0|Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .
1523|0|The Pianist -LRB- is -RRB- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life .
1530|0|The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
1533|0|Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .
1544|0|As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
1545|0|But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
1546|0|Jason Patric and Ray Liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .
1547|0|This often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .
1548|0|It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
1557|0|A funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' is given a full workout .
1559|0|A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .
1560|0|So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
1563|0|And thanks to Kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable .
1566|0|Miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .
1567|0|Grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to Toback 's Heidegger - and Nietzsche-referencing dialogue .
1569|0|Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
1570|0|A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
1573|0|Vividly demonstrates that the director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Patriot Games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .
1575|0|It 's still terrible !
1577|0|Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .
1578|0|A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .
1580|0|A soul-stirring documentary about the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds .
1583|0|It trusts the story it sets out to tell .
1585|0|An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary .
1587|0|Its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .
1588|0|... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
1591|0|A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
1596|0|Noyce has worked wonders with the material .
1600|0|Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
1607|0|The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
1610|0|As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .
1611|0|Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .
1613|0|Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .
1616|0|A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
1617|0|... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages ...
1623|0|... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
1629|0|A brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .
1630|0|The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .
1633|0|One of the funnier movies in town .
1634|0|The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '
1637|0|An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .
1638|0|A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
1639|0|A stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch .
1644|0|A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .
1646|0|Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
1650|0|Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .
1653|0|It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
1655|0|This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .
1661|0|But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
1662|0|It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .
1664|0|A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .
1667|0|But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .
1670|0|This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .
1674|0|The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
1678|0|It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .
1684|0|A compelling film .
1688|0|`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
1691|0|Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .
1692|0|The worst film of the year .
1694|0|The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
1696|0|Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
1698|0|Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .
1699|0|The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .
1700|0|Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .
1701|0|Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .
1704|0|It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...
1715|0|... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
1721|0|Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
1722|0|Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
1723|0|A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite Son of the Bride .
1725|0|The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .
1726|0|Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .
1731|0|I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .
1732|0|It 's just merely very bad .
1737|0|Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
1741|0|And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .
1742|0|As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .
1746|0|A taut , sobering film .
1749|0|The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .
1750|0|But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
1751|0|Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .
1756|0|Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .
1758|0|Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .
1759|0|It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
1760|0|... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
1764|0|It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
1766|0|Delirious fun .
1768|0|Special P.O.V. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense IMAX screen .
1769|0|There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .
1771|0|`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
1772|0|... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -LRB- cool visual backmasking -RRB- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ...
1773|0|This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .
1778|0|One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .
1780|0|Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
1783|0|Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
1785|0|A delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie .
1792|0|Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings .
1795|0|The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
1800|0|The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .
1805|0|She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .
1806|0|Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
1809|0|Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .
1813|0|Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .
1824|0|A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .
1827|0|For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
1832|0|This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
1835|0|Intriguing and stylish .
1844|0|Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
1845|0|Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .
1849|0|Parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults .
1854|0|That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .
1856|0|Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
1858|0|Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
1866|0|The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
1871|0|Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
1875|0|Boring and meandering .
1877|0|The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .
1882|0|A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
1886|0|Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .
1889|0|Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .
1893|0|If you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck .
1895|0|Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .
1899|0|It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
1902|0|A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
1908|0|... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
1912|0|At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .
1920|0|A true-blue delight .
1921|0|Kinnear 's performance is a career-defining revelation .
1924|0|Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
1927|0|The delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two .
1935|0|... a pretentious mess ...
1941|0|A thriller without a lot of thrills .
1942|0|Adaptation 's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary .
1944|0|It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .
1948|0|Real Women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way .
1951|0|Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
1955|0|... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
1966|0|It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by Kwan 's unique directing style .
1970|0|The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because Blanchett and Ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering .
1973|0|is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .
1981|0|So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .
1983|0|It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .
1984|0|Laughably , irredeemably awful .
1989|0|Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .
1994|0|A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
1995|0|An empty , purposeless exercise .
2000|0|The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .
2001|0|It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .
2009|0|Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
2013|0|It picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film .
2017|0|... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
2021|0|To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
2025|0|An enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .
2026|0|An odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the Midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to .
2038|0|This charming , thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards .
2045|0|A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento ...
2048|0|Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
2049|0|Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they ca n't go wrong .
2050|0|A strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being .
2052|0|-LRB- A -RRB- soulless , stupid sequel ...
2054|0|The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful .
2061|0|Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
2063|0|Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
2064|0|Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .
2066|0|A wild , endearing , masterful documentary .
2067|0|Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .
2071|0|Executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted Scrooge could fail to respond .
2088|0|It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .
2092|0|is one of this year 's very best pictures .
2104|0|It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
2106|0|A small movie with a big impact .
2112|0|Good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make Paid in Full worth seeing .
2113|0|An honest , sensitive story from a Vietnamese point of view .
2115|0|Beautifully produced .
2117|0|A film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .
2120|0|Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .
2127|0|Infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by Diane Lane .
2130|0|The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .
2131|0|Spielberg 's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later .
2133|0|Fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film .
2138|0|Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
2140|0|A return to pure Disney magic and is enjoyable family fare .
2144|0|With the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like Tremors , Eight Legged Freaks is prime escapist fare .
2149|0|You can fire a torpedo through some of Clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any Oscars .
2154|0|Daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails .
2158|0|Fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we 're seeing something purer than the real thing .
2162|0|A beautiful , entertaining two hours .
2163|0|Enough said , except : Film overboard !
2169|0|With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
2177|0|This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
2180|0|Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life .
2186|0|The entire cast is extraordinarily good .
2189|0|Cho 's timing is priceless .
2192|0|... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
2198|0|One of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking .
2207|0|It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
2210|0|It 's never dull and always looks good .
2211|0|Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
2212|0|Rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , Jiang Wen 's Devils on the Doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut .
2214|0|likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes .
2218|0|This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .
2219|0|Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
2221|0|The best thing I can say about this film is that I ca n't wait to see what the director does next .
2223|0|You can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored ... audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter .
2230|0|Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
2231|0|... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
2241|0|There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever .
2242|0|There 's already been too many of these films ...
2249|0|Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat 's Fat Girl , Rain is the far superior film .
2250|0|It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
2255|0|As a director , Paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip .
2257|0|Stanley Kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe .
2259|0|Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
2261|0|It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
2264|0|The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
2268|0|Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time .
2270|0|A fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .
2271|0|The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
2278|0|A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro .
2281|0|For the rest of us , sitting through Dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .
2290|0|A truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation .
2292|0|Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year .
2293|0|Daring and beautifully made .
2295|0|Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
2301|0|There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
2302|0|a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002 's first great film
2304|0|Jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness .
2308|0|A generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .
2309|0|The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
2313|0|The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .
2314|0|Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .
2319|0|Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .
2325|0|This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
2326|0|A triumph of pure craft and passionate heart .
2329|0|This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
2331|0|All of it works smoothly under the direction of Spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .
2336|0|Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
2339|0|If you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .
2345|0|You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
2355|0|MacDowell ... gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done .
2360|0|You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
2365|0|I 'd rather watch a rerun of The Powerpuff Girls
2369|0|This is DiCaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .
2374|0|All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .
2377|0|There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
2378|0|It makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing .
2379|0|The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
2383|0|A rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .
2384|0|Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
2386|0|Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood .
2387|0|Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
2388|0|As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
2392|0|Terrible .
2393|0|Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
2401|0|An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them .
2403|0|... what a banal bore the preachy Circuit turns out to be
2407|0|A movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling .
2408|0|Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
2414|0|An engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller .
2416|0|If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
2420|0|That 's fun for kids of any age .
2423|0|Terrific performances , great to look at , and funny .
2426|0|One of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers .
2427|0|The most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of Sergio Leone 's flawed but staggering Once Upon a Time in America .
2433|0|A peculiar misfire that even Tunney ca n't save .
2441|0|If `` Lilo & Stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` Dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years .
2446|0|What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
2447|0|The Master of Disguise is awful .
2452|0|Director Douglas McGrath takes on Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .
2454|0|Piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling .
2457|0|Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
2460|0|It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
2463|0|Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
2464|0|Jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
2469|0|Peter Jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime Tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want .
2471|0|It 's a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX .
2473|0|Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
2479|0|Victor Rosa is Leguizamo 's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance .
2481|0|Pete 's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish .
2487|0|This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare .
2488|0|Pacino and Williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film .
2489|0|A fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries .
2490|0|The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
2493|0|Like Edward Norton in American History X , Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder By Numbers -RRB- delivers a magnetic performance .
2494|0|If you love the music , and I do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ...
2504|0|It 's a masterpeice .
2508|0|No big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
2529|0|This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .
2531|0|He has a great cast and a great idea .
2532|0|Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
2533|0|The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
2534|0|Hailed as a clever exercise in neo-Hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately Chabrolian .
2536|0|A no-holds-barred cinematic treat .
2550|0|The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
2553|0|Despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .
2554|0|One of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then .
2557|0|The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .
2560|0|Visually captivating .
2564|0|Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . '
2565|0|Nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one .
2566|0|Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .
2568|0|One of the worst movies of the year .
2570|0|Predictably soulless techno-tripe .
2574|0|Nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .
2581|0|The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
2587|0|The overall fabric is hypnotic , and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy .
2588|0|If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
2589|0|The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .
2591|0|Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .
2592|0|I have n't laughed that hard in years !
2593|0|With a cast of A-list Brit actors , it is worth searching out .
2595|0|The movie is well crafted , and well executed .
2596|0|It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
2597|0|Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
2605|0|Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash .
2608|0|The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
2609|0|A minor film with major pleasures from Portuguese master Manoel de Oliviera ...
2610|0|For VeggieTales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus .
2611|0|If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .
2618|0|If you 're a comic fan , you ca n't miss it .
2620|0|Fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm .
2625|0|A thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .
2626|0|But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
2630|0|But darned if it does n't also keep us riveted to our seats .
2631|0|Rashomon-for-dipsticks tale .
2637|0|It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .
2646|0|The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative .
2652|0|Ourside the theatre Roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he 's well worth spending some time with .
2654|0|Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
2655|0|What I saw , I enjoyed .
2656|0|The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .
2657|0|Morton deserves an Oscar nomination .
2658|0|A sentimental mess that never rings true .
2662|0|Pompous and garbled .
2663|0|A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
2668|0|This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .
2669|0|Writer-director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured .
2670|0|But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
2674|0|A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
2685|0|The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
2690|0|Informative , intriguing , observant , often touching ... gives a human face to what 's often discussed in purely abstract terms .
2691|0|Whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini DV , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .
2692|0|A humorless journey into a philosophical void .
2695|0|An action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of Day of the Jackal , The French Connection , and Heat .
2699|0|The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
2703|0|Half Past Dead is just such an achievement .
2705|0|This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
2707|0|My Wife is an Actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy .
2709|0|You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
2717|0|Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .
2722|0|I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
2723|0|We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
2743|0|Where 's the movie here ?
2747|0|... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .
2753|0|Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
2755|0|At once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .
2767|0|Poor Ben Bratt could n't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .
2769|0|At times , it actually hurts to watch .
2774|0|Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
2775|0|The entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood .
2777|0|A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .
2780|0|A tremendous piece of work .
2783|0|Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
2784|0|Better effects , better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh .
2785|0|A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
2787|0|What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
2790|0|... hypnotically dull .
2791|0|A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .
2798|0|It 's Pauly Shore awful .
2809|0|... overly melodramatic ...
2815|0|Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
2816|0|The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
2819|0|A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
2821|0|When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
2822|0|A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .
2823|0|A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
2828|0|Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
2839|0|The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
2849|0|Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .
2850|0|Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
2853|0|Assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from Hong Kong 's versatile Stanley Kwan .
2859|0|I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .
2863|0|In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
2875|0|Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .
2882|0|Aggravating and tedious .
2885|0|Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
2892|0|It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
2896|0|Steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .
2907|0|Over the years , Hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and Ice Age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor .
2915|0|Diggs and Lathan are among the chief reasons Brown Sugar is such a sweet and sexy film .
2921|0|More than their unique residences , Home Movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .
2924|0|The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .
2925|0|The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
2927|0|With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .

2937|0|Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
2940|0|There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of Monsoon Wedding in Late Marriage -- and that 's part of what makes Dover Kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent .
2941|0|As pure over-the-top trash , any John Waters movie has it beat by a country mile .
2942|0|-LRB- Reynolds -RRB- takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .
2943|0|A time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain .
2944|0|I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
2945|0|The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
2948|0|A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
2955|0|The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
2964|0|The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels
2965|0|Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore .
2967|0|is a mess .
2976|0|There 's no energy .
2981|0|Without resorting to camp or parody , Haynes -LRB- like Sirk , but differently -RRB- has transformed the rhetoric of Hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .
2986|0|A compassionate , moving portrait of an American -LRB- and an America -RRB- always reaching for something just outside his grasp .
2989|0|... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
2994|0|Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
2997|0|Thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all .
3000|0|But the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
3001|0|a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
3004|0|What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .
3009|0|A bad movie that happened to good actors .
3010|0|It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
3012|0|The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
3014|0|There is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care .
3015|0|Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
3017|0|So beautifully acted and directed , it 's clear that Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses .
3018|0|Lovingly photographed in the manner of a Golden Book sprung to life , Stuart Little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness .
3021|0|A delightful entree in the tradition of food movies .
3025|0|This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
3030|0|The writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
3038|0|Not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days .
3043|0|But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
3046|0|Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
3049|0|Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
3053|0|It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
3056|0|A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
3057|0|Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level .
3058|0|Young Everlyn Sampi , as the courageous Molly Craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film .
3060|0|It is also beautifully acted .
3062|0|The wanton slipperiness of \* Corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art .
3064|0|a joyous occasion
3072|0|That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .
3073|0|A refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market .
3074|0|A compelling motion picture that illustrates an American tragedy .
3075|0|At once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious .
3076|0|Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .
3083|0|On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .
3088|0|Foster and Whitaker are especially fine .
3089|0|I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
3091|0|... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ...
3102|0|It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
3106|0|Enticing and often funny documentary .
3110|0|The 3-D vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
3111|0|turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters
3112|0|Arliss Howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , Big Bad Love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws .
3114|0|Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
3115|0|There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch .
3120|0|The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
3122|0|... with the gifted Pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled Machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself .
3125|0|The cast is phenomenal , especially the women .
3131|0|It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
3132|0|There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
3133|0|once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
3138|0|With few respites , Marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in Moulin Rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it .
3140|0|The most ingenious film comedy since Being John Malkovich .
3144|0|-LRB- Fiji diver Rusi Vulakoro and the married couple Howard and Michelle Hall -RRB- show us the world they love and make us love it , too .
3145|0|This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .
3147|0|The directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on Taylor 's doorstep .
3149|0|Imagine -LRB- if possible -RRB- a Pasolini film without passion or politics , or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching O Fantasma .
3151|0|Exciting documentary .
3157|0|The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
3164|0|Beautifully crafted and brutally honest , Promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the Middle East struggle and into the humanity of its people .
3166|0|Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .
3169|0|Sluggish , tonally uneven .
3175|0|Beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it 's a lyrical endeavour .
3176|0|Hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining .
3178|0|The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
3179|0|A fine , rousing , G-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats .
3180|0|Fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and -LRB- director Phillip -RRB- Noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
3181|0|Australian filmmaker David Flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them .
3183|0|... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh .
3187|0|A small gem from Belgium .
3188|0|Hugh Grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in About a Boy .
3189|0|In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
3198|0|A jaw-droppingly beautiful work
3200|0|There 's no denying that Burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .
3201|0|A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
3202|0|An effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .
3203|0|This is a movie you can trust .
3214|0|About Schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year .
3215|0|A powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall .
3224|0|Although What Time offers Tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .
3239|0|A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .
3240|0|This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
3241|0|A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
3242|0|In XXX , Diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .
3250|0|It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .
3252|0|It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .
3253|0|A sensitive , cultivated treatment of Greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .
3254|0|A stylish thriller .
3255|0|For those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .
3257|0|But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
3262|0|The one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded .
3271|0|I thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love ` real ' .
3278|0|The most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film .
3282|0|If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
3286|0|On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
3288|0|Arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
3297|0|Pacino is the best he 's been in years and Keener is marvelous .
3298|0|An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
3299|0|His work with actors is particularly impressive .
3301|0|... bibbidy-bobbidi-bland .
3305|0|This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
3310|0|Extremely bad .
3311|0|The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .
3313|0|A moving and solidly entertaining comedy\/drama that should bolster director and co-writer
3317|0|The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
3318|0|Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .
3319|0|Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
3323|0|a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
3324|0|A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
3325|0|Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
3329|0|All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .
3332|0|If you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it 's informative and breathtakingly spectacular .
3333|0|It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
3334|0|The movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from Foreman 's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis 's smoothly sinister Freddie and Bettany\/McDowell 's hard-eyed gangster .
3336|0|Smart and taut .
3343|0|Cusack 's just brilliant in this .
3348|0|What 's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director 's talent .
3353|0|Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
3355|0|Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
3359|0|The gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` The Lord of the Rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer\/director Peter Jackson 's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle-earth .
3363|0|Amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances .
3366|0|The thing just never gets off the ground .
3368|0|I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and I recommend it for its originality alone .
3369|0|It 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
3370|0|One of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever .
3371|0|There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
3380|0|And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
3381|0|Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
3383|0|Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
3385|0|Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
3387|0|Driven by a fantastic dual performance from Ian Holm ... the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs .
3390|0|If we 're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she 's French , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?
3391|0|This is an exercise in chilling style , and Twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery .
3394|0|By that measure , it is a failure .
3396|0|Enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary .
3400|0|I loved this film .
3402|0|Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
3403|0|Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
3413|0|90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
3417|0|The most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-Semitism and neo-fascism .
3422|0|Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
3426|0|The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
3431|0|There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
3433|0|... very funny , very enjoyable ...
3436|0|Whether or not you 're enlightened by any of Derrida 's lectures on `` the other '' and `` the self , '' Derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .
3444|0|P.T. Anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible .
3452|0|Others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find Morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .
3455|0|A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
3456|0|Happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music .
3470|0|The genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates .
3475|0|Sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .
3476|0|Overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : God is love .
3478|0|Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .
3479|0|Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .
3482|0|Insomnia is one of the year 's best films and Pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances .
3485|0|It 's that good .
3496|0|Captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head .
3497|0|It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .
3502|0|Those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them .
3507|0|Not since Ghostbusters has a film used Manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .
3509|0|Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
3510|0|Even better than the first one !
3513|0|She may not be real , but the laughs are .
3515|0|The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
3517|0|As giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago .
3522|0|An awful snooze .
3524|0|A thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching British comedy .
3526|0|The film has a terrific look and Salma Hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life .
3527|0|... an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .
3533|0|Better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of Jonathan Swift .
3539|0|This is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice .
3547|0|Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
3555|0|An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .
3557|0|This thing is just garbage .
3574|0|It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
3575|0|-LRB- N -RRB- o matter how much good will the actors generate , Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .
3576|0|I ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ...
3579|0|At just over an hour , Home Movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face .
3581|0|Dramatically lackluster .
3589|0|A lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers .
3593|0|Works as pretty contagious fun .
3598|0|Knows how to make our imagination wonder .
3601|0|-LRB- Westbrook -RRB- makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
3602|0|The overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .
3603|0|Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .
3605|0|Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .
3607|0|As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
3610|0|Maggie Smith as the Ya-Ya member with the O2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment .
3615|0|Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery .
3620|0|The ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations .
3625|0|A half-assed film .
3626|0|Light-years ahead of paint-by-number American blockbusters like Pearl Harbor , at least artistically .
3627|0|The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .
3632|0|Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .
3633|0|As a vehicle to savour Binoche 's skill , the film is well worthwhile .
3634|0|Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
3635|0|The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
3639|0|A colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded .
3640|0|A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
3647|0|Astonishingly skillful and moving ... it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one .
3650|0|The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
3651|0|A much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian English title would have you believe .
3654|0|Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
3659|0|Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
3663|0|It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
3665|0|Sweet and memorable film .
3673|0|Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...
3675|0|I love the robust middle of this picture .
3678|0|-LRB- Less a movie than -RRB- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own \*\*\* in embarrassment .
3679|0|Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .
3683|0|This film puts Wang at the forefront of China 's Sixth Generation of film makers .
3687|0|It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .
3692|0|Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
3693|0|Showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation .
3699|0|It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
3703|0|A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-Century crime as a metaphor for -- well , I 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
3707|0|-LRB- Leigh -RRB- has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors -LRB- improvised over many months -RRB- and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable .
3716|0|A fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` It 's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
3717|0|-LRB- Kline 's -RRB- utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who ca n't quite live up to it .
3718|0|One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
3721|0|He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .
3722|0|The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing Kaufman has carved from Orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .
3725|0|Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
3730|0|Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
3731|0|There is greatness here .
3737|0|Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .
3738|0|Director Nancy Savoca 's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could .
3739|0|As it is , it 's too long and unfocused .
3743|0|A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
3745|0|This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
3751|0|It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .
3753|0|it 's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original .
3758|0|A moving and important film .
3762|0|The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
3765|0|It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .
3766|0|It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
3769|0|This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
3770|0|Hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... love Moore or loathe him , you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions .
3772|0|Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
3778|0|We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
3779|0|Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than Barbershop .

3848|0|Scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .

3932|0|This is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life .
3936|0|A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
3937|0|It 's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion .

3961|0|Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style .
3963|0|A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .

3974|0|The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
3978|0|It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .

3990|0|Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .

4013|0|As pedestrian as they come .
4020|0|It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
4022|0|As warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .

4051|0|Bad and baffling from the get-go .
4055|0|An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
4056|0|This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .
4059|0|The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
4060|0|After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
4065|0|Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but `` Spider-Man '' certainly delivers the goods .

4090|0|The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .
4095|0|An invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker 's extraordinary access to Massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent .
4096|0|The two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .

4110|0|-LRB- A -RRB- thoughtful , visually graceful work .
4114|0|Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .
4117|0|A poignant lyricism runs through Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem .
4118|0|Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
4122|0|The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
4125|0|In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
4128|0|The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
4130|0|An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
4131|0|Is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .
4135|0|Degenerates into hogwash .
4136|0|It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
4139|0|... a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs .
4140|0|... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
4143|0|It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .
4146|0|A dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation .
4151|0|The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
4157|0|an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
4161|0|Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
4162|0|In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
4164|0|A passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action .
4169|0|I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
4170|0|Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .

4181|0|Duvall is strong as always .
4187|0|Moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought .
4188|0|Exciting and well-paced .
4190|0|They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .
4193|0|-LRB- Breheny 's -RRB- lensing of the New Zealand and Cook Island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people .

4203|0|As a science fiction movie , `` Minority Report '' astounds .
4207|0|Despite bearing the Paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement European pickup .
4208|0|All in all , Brown Sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted .
4209|0|Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
4211|0|A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder .

4216|0|Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
4231|0|Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
4233|0|Effective in all its aspects , Margarita Happy Hour represents an auspicious feature debut for Chaiken .
4241|0|Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
4248|0|It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
4255|0|Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
4256|0|All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .
4260|0|The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...
4261|0|Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
4264|0|Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .
4267|0|This makes Minority Report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever .
4270|0|This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
4277|0|To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .

4284|0|Call it magic realism or surrealism , but Miss Wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity .

4296|0|A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking Christian-themed fun .
4297|0|It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
4301|0|What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .

4317|0|A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .

4324|0|The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .

4366|0|While it 's nothing we have n't seen before from Murphy , I Spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort .
4368|0|It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
4369|0|An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
4376|0|A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
4377|0|It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
4379|0|Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they 'd need a shower .

4611|0|Rifkin 's references are ... impeccable throughout .
4612|0|This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in Morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .
4616|0|The film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .

4692|0|We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
4694|0|A shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown .
4698|0|The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .
4701|0|-LRB- Taymor -RRB- utilizes the idea of making Kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work .
4702|0|This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
4709|0|The story ... is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is .
4711|0|Brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate .
4714|0|A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .

4749|0|The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .
4751|0|One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .
4754|0|The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
4763|0|An emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do .
4767|0|Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
4769|0|A beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in Korea .
4770|0|An escapist confection that 's pure entertainment .
4779|0|You feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did .
4781|0|High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
4782|0|Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
4786|0|We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .

4791|0|Idiotic and ugly .
4797|0|A surprisingly funny movie .
4804|0|It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
4806|0|Michael Moore 's latest documentary about America 's thirst for violence is his best film yet ...
4807|0|One of the best rock documentaries ever .
4808|0|A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
4811|0|With Dickens ' words and writer-director Douglas McGrath 's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told .
4822|0|Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .
4823|0|Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
4831|0|As improbable as this premise may seem , Abbass 's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , Lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life .
4835|0|I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was Earnest .
4838|0|The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
4842|0|You 're not merely watching history , you 're engulfed by it .
4849|0|It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
4854|0|The Ya-Ya 's have many secrets and one is - the books are better .
4867|0|It 's all surface psychodramatics .
4872|0|A thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses Grant 's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos .
4874|0|Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans .
4876|0|After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
4883|0|Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .
4885|0|A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .
4890|0|The movie is ingenious fun .
4893|0|Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold .
4894|0|As plain and pedestrian as catsup --
4896|0|It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
4898|0|This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
4899|0|For devotees of French cinema , Safe Conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven .
4908|0|Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
4909|0|Secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie .
4910|0|It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
4913|0|Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .
4920|0|Both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes .
4922|0|Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
4924|0|Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
4925|0|is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
4928|0|Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
4934|0|but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '
4937|0|No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .
4938|0|Insanely hilarious !
4939|0|There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
4941|0|The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge .
4944|0|Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
4946|0|Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
4949|0|The performances are remarkable .
4950|0|Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .
4952|0|-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
4955|0|A smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy .
4960|0|No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .
4961|0|... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
4969|0|It tends to remind one of a really solid Woody Allen film , with its excellent use of New York locales and sharp writing
4974|0|It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
4975|0|The film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on Saturday morning TV especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .
4985|0|True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
4987|0|The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
4989|0|It 's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .
4991|0|A poignant comedy that offers food for thought .
4995|0|Extraordinary debut from Josh Koury .
4999|0|Secret Ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving .

5003|0|It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
5004|0|A witty , low-key romantic comedy .
5008|0|If you go , pack your knitting needles .
5013|0|It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .
5019|0|A major waste ... generic .
5021|0|The movie is a dud .
5022|0|It 's a fun adventure movie for kids -LRB- of all ages -RRB- that like adventure .
5027|0|No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .
5030|0|Fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough .
5031|0|Gives everyone something to shout about .
5052|0|It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
5054|0|What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
5056|0|The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
5057|0|You 'll probably love it .
5058|0|One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
5062|0|Bouquet gives a performance that is masterly .
5078|0|Hate it because it 's lousy .
5080|0|Director Lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .
5081|0|... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
5085|0|... an enjoyably frothy ` date movie ' ...
5087|0|... a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing .
5088|0|It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .
5094|0|Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''
5099|0|Lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , Jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .
5110|0|The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
5112|0|This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
5114|0|One of the most original American productions this year , you 'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a Sunshine State .
5125|0|Many a parent and their teen -LRB- or preteen -RRB- kid could bond while watching A Walk To Remember .
5127|0|It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .
5141|0|... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
5143|0|I like this movie a lot .
5145|0|An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
5151|0|Her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost .
5160|0|There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
5167|0|Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
5169|0|It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
5171|0|It 's always enthralling .
5173|0|Morvern Callar confirms Lynne Ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema .
5177|0|It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
5185|0|The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
5194|0|Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry British filmmakers have strip-mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .
5197|0|Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
5198|0|Eric Schweig and Graham Greene both exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters .
5201|0|The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
5203|0|The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -LRB- unintentionally -RRB- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .
5205|0|Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
5213|0|Even if you 've seen `` Stomp '' -LRB- the stage show -RRB- , you still have to see this !
5214|0|There is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie .
5219|0|Overall , Cletis Tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone .
5220|0|Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .

5232|0|It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .
5236|0|A marvel of production design .
5237|0|Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .
5240|0|I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
5241|0|Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
5242|0|Ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .
5244|0|... really horrible drek .
5249|0|Filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , Baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity .
5251|0|The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .
5253|0|A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
5256|0|A fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame Americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with Kissinger .
5259|0|Could I have been more geeked when I heard that Apollo 13 was going to be released in IMAX format ?
5265|0|Mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully .
5267|0|The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .
5268|0|Nair 's cast is so large it 's Altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion .
5270|0|The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
5274|0|A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .
5283|0|Sweetly sexy , funny and touching .
5289|0|May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .

5305|0|Brings together some of the biggest names in Japanese anime , with impressive results .
5311|0|... spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative .
5313|0|The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
5315|0|Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
5324|0|Mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the Yiddish stage .

5342|0|A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams .
5346|0|-LRB- A -RRB- devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama .
5352|0|It is definitely worth seeing .
5357|0|This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
5358|0|Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
5361|0|Remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it 's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .
5364|0|In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
5367|0|The film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .
5374|0|Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .
5386|0|For most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director M. Night Shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that Mel Gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo .
5392|0|Forget about one Oscar nomination for Julianne Moore this year - she should get all five .
5396|0|Graphic sex may be what 's attracting audiences to Unfaithful , but gripping performances by Lane and Gere are what will keep them awake .
5400|0|... a bland murder-on-campus yawner .
5401|0|The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
5403|0|This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
5404|0|One of the most incoherent features in recent memory .
5409|0|- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
5414|0|Just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .
5417|0|Here is a divine monument to a single man 's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music .
5420|0|This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
5422|0|This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had , lost , and got back .
5427|0|This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
5431|0|The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them .
5434|0|A moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
5436|0|A slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time .
5438|0|Vulgar is too optimistic a title .
5440|0|A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale .
5447|0|Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .
5451|0|The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
5454|0|One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .
5456|0|Poignant and moving , A Walk to Remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter .
5459|0|` Anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
5460|0|To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
5461|0|Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
5462|0|Adaptation is simply brilliant .
5470|0|Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
5481|0|A must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .
5482|0|An enthralling aesthetic experience , one that 's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty .
5486|0|Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
5488|0|A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
5495|0|... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
5501|0|Good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .
5509|0|The film offers an intriguing what-if premise .
5511|0|Very stupid and annoying .
5514|0|In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
5515|0|The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
5518|0|Crummy .
5521|0|A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .
5522|0|Nothing about this movie works .
5530|0|Meeting , even exceeding expectations , it 's the best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth .
5534|0|Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
5536|0|A remarkable film by Bernard Rose .
5538|0|There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
5543|0|From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
5550|0|The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .
5552|0|Between them , De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .
5554|0|A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .
5556|0|This is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies .
5557|0|What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .
5566|0|What makes Salton Sea surprisingly engrossing is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .
5572|0|A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
5574|0|It 's a cool event for the whole family .
5576|0|Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
5582|0|Schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film 's present with the playful paranoia of the film 's past . '

5587|0|Salma goes native and she 's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a Mexican icon .
5591|0|Ben Kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of Ghandi gone bad .
5595|0|Banal and predictable .
5596|0|You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .
5601|0|Two hours of junk .
5603|0|A colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters .
5608|0|In addition to Hoffman 's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .
5612|0|What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
5613|0|Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .
5614|0|It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
5617|0|An almost unbearably morbid love story .
5625|0|Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years .
5626|0|It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .
5627|0|Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .
5629|0|The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .

5638|0|The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
5639|0|Brilliantly written and well-acted , Yellow Asphalt is an uncompromising film .
5641|0|borrows a bit from the classics `` Wait Until Dark '' and `` Extremities '' ... But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself .
5648|0|As commander-in-chief of this film , Bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world .
5650|0|The entire cast is first-rate , especially Sorvino .
5652|0|... could easily be called the best Korean film of 2002 .
5653|0|A predictable , manipulative stinker .
5656|0|Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .
5659|0|This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
5660|0|... once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable .
5661|0|An interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama .
5662|0|Nicole Kidman makes it a party worth attending .
5666|0|Make like the title and dodge this one .
5677|0|... a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking .
5678|0|A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others .
5679|0|Fantastic !
5681|0|It 's uninteresting .
5683|0|Leave it to the French to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama .

5688|0|Bluer than the Atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie ... is , also , frequently hilarious .

5709|0|Uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year .
5715|0|A funny , triumphant , and moving documentary .
5722|0|Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
5725|0|Not to mention absolutely refreshed .
5726|0|My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...
5729|0|A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .
5730|0|A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
5734|0|By turns very dark and very funny .
5736|0|` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '

5750|0|An engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients .
5754|0|First and foremost ... the reason to go see `` Blue Crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by David Hennings .
5755|0|An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
5758|0|Get out your pooper-scoopers .
5767|0|With this masterful , flawless film , -LRB- Wang -RRB- emerges in the front ranks of China 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers .
5780|0|About as enjoyable , I would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .
5783|0|This is just lazy writing .
5785|0|Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
5786|0|The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
5787|0|A riveting documentary .
5788|0|MY LITTLE EYE is the best little `` horror '' movie I 've seen in years .
5798|0|An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
5800|0|A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .
5803|0|... unbearably lame .
5809|0|The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
5810|0|Miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .
5813|0|This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
5817|0|It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
5818|0|Many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and I do n't think that A.C. will help this movie one bit .
5820|0|The script by David Koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .
5822|0|Well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious .
5829|0|Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness , but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .
5830|0|`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
5834|0|With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
5837|0|Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
5838|0|That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .
5840|0|It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .
5841|0|That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .
5842|0|That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
5847|0|What results is the best performance from either in years .
5848|0|You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
5849|0|The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .
5853|0|When a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there 's something there .
5858|0|The case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause .
5859|0|An uplifting , near-masterpiece .
5861|0|A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
5866|0|` In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
5867|0|Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
5869|0|The quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by Rachel Griffiths .
5870|0|-LRB- A -RRB- poorly executed comedy .
5871|0|A deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed .
5873|0|It 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .
5880|0|The performances are immaculate , with Roussillon providing comic relief .
5881|0|A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
5882|0|A gem of a movie .
5884|0|Simply put , `` Far From Heaven '' is a masterpiece .
5887|0|Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
5893|0|Shanghai Ghetto may not be as dramatic as Roman Polanski 's The Pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high .
5895|0|This is one of the year 's best films .
5897|0|An entertaining British hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .
5903|0|Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
5906|0|The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
5907|0|Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
5908|0|... even if you 've never heard of Chaplin , you 'll still be glued to the screen .
5921|0|Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .
5925|0|You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
5928|0|What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
5929|0|Beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm .
5930|0|The camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm .
5933|0|It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
5944|0|A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
5946|0|Full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .
5953|0|Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
5955|0|Move over Bond ; this girl deserves a sequel .
5959|0|A terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi .
5961|0|If you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this Oscar-nominated documentary takes you there .
5962|0|An animation landmark as monumental as Disney 's 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs .
5977|0|A fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
5981|0|The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
5986|0|A funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a British cast to rival Gosford Park 's .
5987|0|There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
5989|0|It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .
5992|0|You have no affinity for most of the characters .
5998|0|... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that I ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .
6011|0|A first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you .
6012|0|The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .
6013|0|It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
6014|0|A coming-of-age movie that Hollywood would n't have the guts to make .
6018|0|One of the most exciting action films to come out of China in recent years .
6020|0|A real snooze .
6021|0|One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
6024|0|This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
6025|0|The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .
6028|0|A fanciful drama about Napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility .
6029|0|Excellent performances from Jacqueline Bisset and Martha Plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama .
6031|0|Below is well below expectations .
6035|0|I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
6047|0|To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
6048|0|Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , Metropolis is a feast for the eyes .
6054|0|Oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .
6057|0|The pleasure of Read My Lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string .
6059|0|The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
6066|0|Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
6085|0|A genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama .
6091|0|The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .
6092|0|Despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real Americans '' make this a charmer .
6093|0|Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
6095|0|Boisterous , heartfelt comedy .
6099|0|A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
6100|0|It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
6102|0|Much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors .
6112|0|Should have gone straight to video .
6113|0|classic cinema served up with heart and humor
6116|0|Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .
6121|0|A movie I loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance .
6122|0|Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story .
6123|0|What an embarrassment .
6126|0|Sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .
6127|0|As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
6132|0|Both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of Russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement .
6134|0|The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 Ever is any indication .
6142|0|An immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music .
6148|0|One of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the French film industry in years .
6149|0|As the movie traces Mr. Brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .
6152|0|Apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present Hollywood program .
6153|0|It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .
6155|0|... the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see .
6158|0|Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
6159|0|Spy Kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : It actually improves upon the original hit movie .
6161|0|Maggie G. makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen .
6162|0|Very well-written and very well-acted .
6163|0|This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .
6166|0|Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts
6169|0|As satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago ... has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency .
6174|0|A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
6175|0|The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
6176|0|The solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .
6182|0|Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic .
6188|0|-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
6191|0|The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
6193|0|A terrific B movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory .
6195|0|The slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
6198|0|One of the worst films of 2002 .
6204|0|It 's a masterpiece .
6205|0|I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .
6225|0|Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch .
6230|0|It 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .
6232|0|It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .
6236|0|Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .
6239|0|Most haunting about `` Fence '' is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen .
6254|0|Serious and thoughtful .
6255|0|Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
6256|0|This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
6259|0|Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece .
6263|0|Every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be .
6264|0|Raimi and his team could n't have done any better in bringing the story of Spider-Man to the big screen .
6265|0|I still want my money back .
6275|0|Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
6277|0|` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
6281|0|Thumbs down .
6283|0|The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
6285|0|The Trials of Henry Kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ... because you get it .
6287|0|Like the best of Godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .
6289|0|Puts to rest any thought that the German film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food .
6292|0|Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
6294|0|A heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers ' hearts .
6301|0|A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls .
6302|0|The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
6303|0|Ms. Seigner and Mr. Serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters .
6304|0|Admirers of director Abel Ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , R Xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .
6305|0|Witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful .
6307|0|A chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody .
6308|0|... one of the more influential works of the ` Korean New Wave ' .
6314|0|Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
6318|0|Be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense .
6329|0|A powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s .
6330|0|are both superb , while Huppert ... is magnificent .
6333|0|In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .
6335|0|Bad movie .
6344|0|It 's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
6345|0|Scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar .
6348|0|A miraculous movie , I 'm Going Home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .
6354|0|Sexy and romantic .
6356|0|It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
6363|0|The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make Love a joy to behold .
6368|0|Adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel .
6381|0|The film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .
6382|0|... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .
6389|0|Best of all is Garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .
6391|0|A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .
6401|0|Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
6402|0|Director Jay Russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
6403|0|McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
6404|0|One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .
6406|0|Often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers .
6409|0|A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
6413|0|This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .
6415|0|An Inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds .
6417|0|The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
6420|0|Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
6421|0|Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
6422|0|This is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force .
6423|0|It 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout .
6428|0|It 's Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
6432|0|Barry convinces us he 's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful .
6433|0|Not only does Spider-Man deliver , but I suspect it might deliver again and again .
6439|0|Isabelle Huppert excels as the enigmatic Mika and Anna Mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of Chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries .
6441|0|Nair 's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while Thurman and Lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances .
6443|0|Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
6445|0|Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
6447|0|The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
6449|0|Holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life 's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks .
6457|0|An extraordinary dramatic experience .
6458|0|It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .
6463|0|... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
6469|0|Young Hanks and Fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
6474|0|No , I hate it .
6478|0|Another Best of the Year selection .
6481|0|An Asian neo-realist treasure .
6484|0|See Scratch for the history , see Scratch for the music , see Scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion .
6485|0|A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
6494|0|There 's no reason to miss Interview with the Assassin
6496|0|I 've never seen -LRB- a remake -RRB- do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...
6502|0|Mike White 's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make `` The Good Girl '' a film worth watching .
6508|0|Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .
6509|0|It 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts Blue Crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies .
6513|0|But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
6517|0|There 's nothing like love to give a movie a B-12 shot , and CQ shimmers with it .
6523|0|One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
6524|0|If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans .
6526|0|The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
6530|0|An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
6534|0|This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
6537|0|Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
6544|0|That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .
6545|0|What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
6547|0|Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .
6551|0|Rarely have I seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart .
6552|0|The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
6558|0|Simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular New Yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy .
6562|0|A stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of Beauty and the Beast and 1930s horror films
6563|0|Abysmally pathetic
6564|0|The best animated feature to hit theaters since Beauty and the Beast 11 years ago .
6581|0|But as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care .
6586|0|I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson .
6593|0|Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
6604|0|Remarkable for its intelligence and intensity .
6609|0|The most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` Jackass '' fan could want .
6611|0|Consummate actor Barry has done excellent work here .
6612|0|Majidi 's direction has never been smoother or more confident .
6616|0|E.T. works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old Robert MacNaughton , 6-year-old Drew Barrymore and 10-year-old Henry Thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet .
6618|0|Changing Lanes is an anomaly for a Hollywood movie ; it 's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say .
6620|0|An enthralling , entertaining feature .
6623|0|It 's worth taking the kids to .
6624|0|I 'm not sure which half of Dragonfly is worse : The part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid .
6626|0|The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
6628|0|Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
6629|0|The rest of the film ... is dudsville .
6631|0|It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
6641|0|Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
6643|0|A highly spirited , imaginative kid 's movie that broaches neo-Augustinian theology : Is God stuck in Heaven because He 's afraid of His best-known creation ?
6645|0|McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
6654|0|An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
6655|0|wo n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , Daniel Auteuil , have a whale of a good time .
6659|0|The cast is top-notch and I predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over Michael Idemoto as Michael .
6665|0|... fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist 's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film .
6667|0|Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .
6670|0|The crap continues .
6675|0|The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
6676|0|Wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture .
6686|0|Horrible .
6687|0|A strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing Spider-Man .
6693|0|The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .
6701|0|Without Shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .
6707|0|The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .
6708|0|Payne has created a beautiful canvas , and Nicholson proves once again that he 's the best brush in the business .
6712|0|Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
6715|0|A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys .
6726|0|It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
6732|0|Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
6739|0|With ` Bowling for Columbine , ' Michael Moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear .
6746|0|Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
6750|0|A sexy , surprising romance ... Idemoto and Kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger .
6756|0|Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , Narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .
6757|0|Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .
6760|0|A strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet .
6768|0|Viveka Seldahl and Sven Wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget .
6771|0|A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
6774|0|Stale and
6775|0|Moving and vibrant .
6779|0|The Pianist is Polanski 's best film .
6780|0|A compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .
6781|0|It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
6782|0|Enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary .
6786|0|Twenty years later , E.T. is still a cinematic touchstone .
6795|0|A film centering on a traditional Indian wedding in contemporary New Delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but Mira Nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences .
6796|0|It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
6797|0|An excellent sequel .
6802|0|A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
6803|0|Last Orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced .
6804|0|The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
6805|0|Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
6806|0|Seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as Happiness was ... Hence , Storytelling is far more appealing .
6810|0|... wise and elegiac ...
6812|0|Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
6813|0|The story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director Shekhar Kapur supplies with tremendous skill .
6814|0|What makes How I Killed My Father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is Fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching .
6817|0|A movie of riveting power and sadness .
6824|0|Almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what William James once called ` the gift of tears . '
6828|0|It 's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage .
6835|0|The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .
6836|0|10 minutes into the film you 'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .
6837|0|The determination of Pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .
6842|0|A delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a Copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them .
6844|0|Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
6847|0|The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon\/Bourne or his predicament .
6852|0|Provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the Holocaust .
6856|0|The leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly .
6866|0|Funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , Bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking .
6867|0|-LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
6869|0|My Big Fat Greek Wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it 's also a -- dare I say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally American , I might add -- slice of comedic bliss .
6873|0|and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience .
6875|0|Neil Burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .
6879|0|Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
6880|0|Funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic .
6881|0|Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia .
6884|0|I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
6886|0|-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
6889|0|This is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .
6895|0|Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
6897|0|Offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .
6898|0|One of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old Walt doodled Steamboat Willie .
6906|0|Eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot .
6909|0|The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
6913|0|Berry 's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` Die Another Day '' one of the most entertaining Bonds in years
6916|0|Flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old Jack Nicholson could be looking at his 12th Oscar nomination by proving that he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary .
6919|0|It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
6923|0|Ryan Gosling ... is at 22 a powerful young actor .
6934|0|If you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse .
6945|0|Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .
6948|0|A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
6950|0|What 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up .
6951|0|Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
6956|0|The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
6957|0|The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and Mr. Day-Lewis roars with leonine power .
6958|0|What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .
6966|0|Huppert and Girardot give performances of exceptional honesty .
6968|0|It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
6971|0|Devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .
6973|0|A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '
6979|0|Great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make Gangster No. 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience .
6980|0|Highly engaging .
6982|0|... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
6983|0|It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
6987|0|insightfully written , delicately performed
6995|0|If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
7004|0|Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
7013|0|This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
7019|0|Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
7021|0|Soderbergh , like Kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit .
7022|0|... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
7026|0|It 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual Spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team .
7029|0|What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
7038|0|But the performances of Pacino , Williams , and Swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .
7039|0|The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .
7048|0|Vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of Mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .
7049|0|One-of-a-kind near-masterpiece .
7050|0|MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
7053|0|Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
7058|0|The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
7060|0|As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
7062|0|The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects .
7073|0|` It 's painful to watch Witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination , I mean , Alabama . '
7087|0|One of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time .
7089|0|Works because Reno does n't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience .
7091|0|Fred Schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen .
7092|0|Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero .
7096|0|To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for God 's sake !
7111|0|Drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , Byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth .
7116|0|Gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways .
7118|0|A less-than-thrilling thriller .
7123|0|Schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch British actor who did not appear in Gosford Park -LRB- as well as one , Ms. Mirren , who did -RRB- , has succeeded beyond all expectation .
7128|0|A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
7131|0|The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
7133|0|Serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination .
7136|0|A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
7139|0|The performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .
7142|0|Extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten .
7149|0|Wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many .
7153|0|Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period , no timeout .
7154|0|No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
7155|0|Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
7161|0|For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between Sullivan and his son .
7164|0|A venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director 's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .
7168|0|An enjoyable experience .
7170|0|... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
7177|0|The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- achievement does n't match his ambition .
7184|0|A DOA dud from frame one .
7185|0|A vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition .
7187|0|Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure .
7193|0|This comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative .
7194|0|A must see for all sides of the political spectrum
7197|0|In the new release of Cinema Paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned .
7198|0|A worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .
7203|0|For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
7207|0|Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the U.S. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema .

7216|0|Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
7222|0|Give credit to everyone from Robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works .
7228|0|Irwin is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs .
7231|0|It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
7233|0|One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved .
7234|0|a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than `` Memento ''
7237|0|The film 's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them .
7239|0|-LRB- Sam 's -RRB- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
7243|0|-LRB- Danny Huston gives -RRB- an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent 's smirk .
7244|0|Just like a splendid meal , Red Dragon satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .
7245|0|Director Juan Jose Campanella could have turned this into an Argentine retread of `` Iris '' or `` American Beauty , '' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films .
7246|0|Bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .
7250|0|Bogdanovich taps deep into the Hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal .
7252|0|Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
7261|0|Exceptionally well acted by Diane Lane and Richard Gere .
7262|0|This is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on Jerry Springer .
7264|0|It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
7278|0|Ong 's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent Chinese immigrant 's experiences in New York City .
7291|0|Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
7297|0|Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
7300|0|It does n't work as either .
7302|0|Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
7306|0|It 's a very valuable film ...
7308|0|That rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults .
7310|0|A cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty .
7320|0|There 's nothing to gain from watching They .
7321|0|The all-French cast is marveilleux .
7323|0|It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
7326|0|But believe it or not , it 's one of the most beautiful , evocative works I 've seen .
7334|0|Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience .
7344|0|Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
7351|0|A well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ` direct-to-video ' release .
7354|0|A conventional but heartwarming tale .
7356|0|Woody Allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody .
7360|0|It turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .
7361|0|In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
7363|0|A slick , engrossing melodrama .
7364|0|This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
7369|0|It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .
7371|0|A movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .
7373|0|Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .
7375|0|Still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .
7376|0|Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat .

7400|0|Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
7401|0|Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
7406|0|One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
7409|0|I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
7413|0|More intimate than spectacular , E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
7420|0|`` Home Movie '' is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time .
7422|0|The movie is brilliant , really .
7423|0|Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .

7549|0|Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .
7551|0|A pleasant piece of escapist entertainment .
7552|0|The best comedy concert movie I 've seen since Cho 's previous concert comedy film , I 'm the One That I Want , in 2000 .
7554|0|A touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli .
7557|0|That , in itself , is extraordinary .
7560|0|A classy , sprightly spin on film .
7561|0|It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
7565|0|Just plain bad .
7566|0|It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .
7567|0|A fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
7568|0|The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
7569|0|It is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .
7573|0|Leave it to John Sayles to take on developers , the Chamber of Commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute .
7579|0|Refreshing .
7582|0|Too bad none of it is funny .
7584|0|Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .
7586|0|For dance completists only .
7588|0|There 's so much to look at in Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
7589|0|More timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by Iran to the Afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food .
7594|0|How about surprising us by trying something new ?
7605|0|Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
7610|0|It 's soulful and unslick , and that 's apparently just what -LRB- Aniston -RRB- has always needed to grow into a movie career .
7612|0|The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
7617|0|It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .
7619|0|Seagal , who looks more like Danny Aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
7623|0|Griffin & Co. manage to be spectacularly outrageous .
7629|0|Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with Shimizu is very believable .
7634|0|It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
7637|0|It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .
7638|0|Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
7642|0|A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
7651|0|The trailer is a riot .
7653|0|This enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends .
7659|0|Stands as one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .
7662|0|It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .
7666|0|-LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
7668|0|An inventive , absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist .
7669|0|A finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere .
7670|0|The film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .
7675|0|... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster .
7678|0|Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .
7685|0|Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .
7686|0|Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
7687|0|The Paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -LRB- restored -RRB- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .
7696|0|This is an extraordinary film , not least because it is Japanese and yet feels universal .
7698|0|Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
7703|0|Fun and nimble .
7712|0|Dramas like this make it human .
7718|0|Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
7722|0|Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
7723|0|... a true delight .
7725|0|The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
7726|0|The production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other .
7735|0|A work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry .
7739|0|Cinematic poo .
7743|0|So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
7744|0|It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
7745|0|Morvern rocks .
7751|0|Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest .
7759|0|The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
7760|0|If you like quirky , odd movies and\/or the ironic , here 's a fun one .
7761|0|Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , No Such Thing is a fascinating little tale .
7762|0|A captivating and intimate study about dying and loving ...
7768|0|Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
7772|0|Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .
7776|0|A breathtaking adventure for all ages , Spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images .
7777|0|More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .
7779|0|Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .
7782|0|Imagine O. Henry 's The Gift of the Magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of NYC 's drug scene .
7784|0|It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
7796|0|It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
7797|0|Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
7809|0|Slap me , I saw this movie .
7817|0|The heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in -LRB- this -RRB- meandering and pointless French coming-of-age import from writer-director Anne-Sophie Birot .
7821|0|The most repugnant adaptation
7822|0|Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum .
7823|0|A decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies .
7831|0|A gripping drama .
7832|0|Darkly funny and frequently insightful .
7837|0|Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
7838|0|smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - Broadway play .
7839|0|This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
7841|0|It sucked .
7848|0|Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
7852|0|The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
7860|0|Runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino 's performance .
7861|0|Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .
7864|0|A distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances .
7865|0|Demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking .
7866|0|In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
7867|0|A fine production with splendid singing by Angela Gheorghiu , Ruggero Raimondi , and Roberto Alagna .
7871|0|An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
7873|0|It 's that painful .
7875|0|Highly watchable stuff .
7880|0|Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
7883|0|an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
7885|0|Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
7888|0|The comedy is nonexistent .
7892|0|Armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect Forster to the always hilarious Meara and Levy , Like Mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud .
7907|0|By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
7914|0|It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
7915|0|Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
7916|0|Promises is one film that 's truly deserving of its Oscar nomination .
7922|0|In the end , there is n't much to it .
7924|0|Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
7927|0|Really quite funny .
7930|0|But mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .
7931|0|Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , Haneke 's portrait of an upper class Austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .
7934|0|A backstage must-see for true fans of comedy .
7935|0|Allen 's funniest and most likeable movie in years .
7942|0|With Dirty Deeds , David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen .
7943|0|But the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .
7945|0|One of the finest , most humane and important Holocaust movies ever made .
7951|0|Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
7952|0|A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '
7959|0|If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .
7969|0|The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
7976|0|Kinnear and Dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .
7979|0|The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .
7982|0|But Mr. Polanski creates images even more haunting than those in Mr. Spielberg 's 1993 classic .
7986|0|Director Charles Stone III applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about Drumline is its energy .
7988|0|`` Frailty '' starts out like a typical Bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -LRB- and better -RRB- than most films with this theme .
7989|0|Diane Lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in Unfaithful .
7990|0|A mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in .
7995|0|The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
8004|0|LaBute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .
8007|0|A film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in San Diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times I saw the film .
8014|0|A must for fans of British cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride .
8015|0|It 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .
8016|0|Romantic comedy and Dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .
8018|0|A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the New Age .
8020|0|The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .
8030|0|The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment .
8032|0|There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
8033|0|The film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished .
8034|0|A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .
8036|0|too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
8040|0|Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .
8041|0|Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
8043|0|This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .
8050|0|If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .
8060|0|Me Without You has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood .
8062|0|... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
8067|0|The film is bright and flashy in all the right ways .
8069|0|The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .
8070|0|What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
8071|0|A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .
8074|0|Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
8075|0|Brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as Bond in Die Another Day .
8082|0|Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
8084|0|No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
8087|0|When compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , Davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic .
8091|0|Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
8093|0|A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .
8095|0|It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .
8096|0|Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
8103|0|Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
8108|0|None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
8113|0|It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
8120|0|Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .
8127|0|The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
8129|0|Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .
8131|0|A wildly entertaining scan of Evans ' career .
8132|0|Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .
8139|0|I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
8141|0|With an admirably dark first script by Brent Hanley , Paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .
8142|0|Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness .
8143|0|Douglas McGrath 's Nicholas Nickleby does Dickens as it should be done cinematically .
8150|0|A thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions .
8156|0|An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
8158|0|The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
8161|0|It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
8165|0|Especially give credit to Affleck .
8167|0|It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb .
8168|0|After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .
8174|0|It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
8176|0|You 'll forget about it by Monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids .
8177|0|Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
8178|0|No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
8180|0|If you 're a fan of the series you 'll love it and probably want to see it twice .
8186|0|Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
8188|0|As a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , Kissing Jessica Steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious .
8189|0|Humorous and heartfelt , Douglas McGrath 's version of ` Nicholas Nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful .
8190|0|... a solid , well-formed satire .
8194|0|It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
8197|0|It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
8199|0|The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .
8200|0|About as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come .
8201|0|Thumbs up to Paxton for not falling into the Hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .
8208|0|We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
8209|0|Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .
8211|0|This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
8213|0|The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
8214|0|Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-Semitism ever seen on screen .
8216|0|I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat .
8219|0|This is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope .
8220|0|-LRB- Ferrera -RRB- has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .
8224|0|An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .
8226|0|Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .
8229|0|It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do .
8233|0|It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
8234|0|A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .
8235|0|Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
8239|0|Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
8240|0|The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
8245|0|While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of Cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds .
8249|0|Good , solid storytelling .
8250|0|As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .
8253|0|A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .
8254|0|Congrats Disney on a job well done , I enjoyed it just as much !
8263|0|Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
8266|0|Takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights .
8272|0|Hard , endearing , caring , warm .
8274|0|Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
8279|0|Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
8288|0|Renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .
8293|0|These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people .
8296|0|In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .
8297|0|A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by Michael Gondry .
8302|0|... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
8304|0|Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
8306|0|The sheer dumbness of the plot -LRB- other than its one good idea -RRB- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .
8308|0|Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .
8310|0|Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message .
8312|0|`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .
8313|0|Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
8318|0|Rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .
8324|0|Devos and Cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable .
8328|0|The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .
8336|0|When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
8347|0|A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .
8350|0|Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
8356|0|Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
8357|0|... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .
8361|0|If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
8364|0|In his U.S. debut , Mr. Schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist .
8365|0|Sex With Strangers is fascinating ...
8366|0|It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
8369|0|And it 's a lousy one at that .
8373|0|In addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , Changing Lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight .
8377|0|My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .
8378|0|Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
8384|0|A powerful performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an M-16 .
8386|0|By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
8400|0|Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
8407|0|Terminally brain dead production .
8422|0|The acting is n't much better .
8427|0|More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .
8429|0|A very charming and funny movie .
8431|0|`` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time .
8432|0|A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
8433|0|A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .
